An AI agent that maintains GitHub repositories: triaging issues, reviewing PRs, monitoring repo health, and building features through an Architect → Executor → Reviewer development cycle.

Built on [agentic-pi](https://github.com/nearform/lastlight/tree/main/packages/agentic-pi) (workflow phases) and [`@earendil-works/pi-ai`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@earendil-works/pi-ai) (in-process chat) with a lightweight TypeScript harness for webhook ingestion, cron scheduling, and process management. Provider-agnostic — point `LASTLIGHT_MODEL` at any `provider/model` pi-ai supports (defaults to `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6`).

## Monorepo layout

This repository is a **pnpm + Turborepo** workspace. The harness/server internals
now live under `apps/server/` (formerly the repo root). At a glance:

```
apps/
  server/   lastlight-core  — the harness + server (src, config, workflows,
                               skills, agent-context, deploy, dashboard, spec, …)
  www/      lastlight-www     — the Astro marketing/docs site → lastlight.dev
  evals/    lastlight-evals   — the eval harness → evals.lastlight.dev
packages/
  cli/               lastlight              — the lean, published global CLI (+ the Claude Code plugin)
  shared/            lastlight-shared      — shared utilities (e.g. the provider registry)
  workflow-engine/   lastlight-workflow-engine — the reusable workflow runner
  code-facts/        lastlight-code-facts  — deterministic PR analysis (`lastlight facts`)
  agentic-pi/        agentic-pi            — the coding-agent harness core runs in the sandbox
```

Seven packages publish to npm: `lastlight`, `lastlight-core`,
`lastlight-workflow-engine`, `lastlight-shared`, `lastlight-code-facts`,
`lastlight-evals`, and `agentic-pi`. The root package (`lastlight-monorepo`) is
private (as are `lastlight-www` and both dashboards). Common scripts run from the root
via Turborepo: `pnpm build` / `pnpm test` / `pnpm typecheck` (each `turbo run …`),
and `pnpm dev` (= `pnpm --filter lastlight-core dev`). See the root `CLAUDE.md`
for the canonical workspace map and orientation.

## Production Setup (Clean Server)

The fastest way to go from a bare server to a running Last Light instance:

```bash
npx lastlight setup
```

The setup wizard walks you through:

1. **GitHub App** — enter your App ID, Installation ID, and PEM key path
2. **Domain & TLS** — optional Caddy config for automatic HTTPS
3. **Managed repositories** — the `owner/repo` list the bot operates on
4. **Model provider + API key** — pick from any of pi-ai's 15+ supported
   providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, Mistral, Groq, Cerebras, xAI,
   Hugging Face, Moonshot, NVIDIA, Fireworks, Together, DeepSeek, Z.AI,
   Kimi for Coding, MiniMax, OpenRouter), then enter the model id and the
   matching API key. See `packages/shared/src/providers.ts` for the full registry.
5. **Webhook secret** — auto-generated if you don't have one
6. **Slack** — optional bot token and app token for Slack integration
7. **Admin dashboard** — optional password protection

It scaffolds your private **deployment overlay** at `instance/` — writing
`instance/config.yaml` (your managed repos), `instance/secrets/.env`, and copying
your PEM to `instance/secrets/app.pem` (mode 600) — then offers to build and start
the Docker stack. When it's done you have a running instance ready to receive
webhooks. Everything deployment-specific lives in `instance/`, which is mounted
read-only and never baked into the image; edit it and `docker compose restart agent`
to apply (no rebuild). See [Deployment overlay](#deployment-overlay) for the model.

> **Requires:** Node.js 22.12+ (the repo pins 22 in `.nvmrc`), Docker, and a
> GitHub App already created
> (see [Create a GitHub App](#1-create-a-github-app) below).

For a Docker-free production install (systemd unit, gondolin sandbox), see [Native deploy](#native-systemd-deploy) below.

## Quick Start (Local Dev)

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22.12+ (`engines.node`; the repo pins 22 in `.nvmrc`)
- Docker Desktop (or compatible) — only needed for `LASTLIGHT_SANDBOX=docker`; gondolin runs without it on macOS/Linux
- A GitHub App (see [Create a GitHub App](#1-create-a-github-app) below)
- An API key for whichever provider your chosen `LASTLIGHT_MODEL` uses.
  The wizard surfaces pi-ai's 15+ providers — see `packages/shared/src/providers.ts` for the
  full registry (e.g. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for anthropic/…, `OPENAI_API_KEY`
  for openai/…, `GROQ_API_KEY` for groq/…, `GEMINI_API_KEY` for google/…,
  `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` for the openrouter/… aggregator).

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nearform/lastlight.git
cd lastlight
pnpm install          # this is a pnpm workspace — installs every package
```

Copy and edit the environment file. It lives in the **server package**, not the
repo root — `scripts/dev-local.sh` sources `apps/server/.env`:

```bash
cp apps/server/.env.example apps/server/.env
```

Fill in the required values in `apps/server/.env`:

```bash
# GitHub App (required)
GITHUB_APP_ID=123456
GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=./your-app.private-key.pem
GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID=789012

# Webhook secret (required for webhook mode)
WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-secret-here

# Model + provider — the wizard surfaces pi-ai's 15+ providers. The
# registry lives in packages/shared/src/providers.ts; pick any `provider/model` it lists.
LASTLIGHT_MODEL=anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
# OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...
# GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...      GEMINI_API_KEY=AIza...   HF_TOKEN=hf_...
# XAI_API_KEY=...
# ZAI_API_KEY=...        MISTRAL_API_KEY=...    FIREWORKS_API_KEY=...

# Sandbox backend (default: gondolin; alternatives: docker, none)
# LASTLIGHT_SANDBOX=gondolin
```

### Run

`pnpm --filter lastlight-core dev` runs the harness on your host. Sandbox mode is selected by `LASTLIGHT_SANDBOX`:

- **`gondolin`** (default) — agentic-pi spawns a per-phase QEMU micro-VM in-process. Uses HVF on macOS, KVM on Linux. No Docker needed.
- **`docker`** — agentic-pi runs inside a per-phase sibling Docker container (the `lastlight-sandbox:latest` image). Requires Docker. Useful for prod-like smoke testing.
- **`none`** — agent runs in-process on your host with no isolation. Dev only — never in production.

The dev script is explicitly safe with your personal config:

| | Touched? |
|---|---|
| `~/.gitconfig` (your identity, credential helper) | ❌ skipped (`LASTLIGHT_LOCAL_DEV=1`) |
| `./data/agent-sessions/` | ✅ project-local; shim envelope jsonls for the dashboard live here |
| `./data/` (the state dir) | ✅ bind-mounted at `/data` when using `LASTLIGHT_SANDBOX=docker`, as the production volume is |
| `./data/lastlight.db`, `./data/sandboxes/`, `./data/logs/` | ✅ project-local state, gitignored |

If you want the Docker sandbox mode locally, build the image once first:

```bash
cd apps/server   # the compose file lives in the server package
docker compose --profile build-only build sandbox-base   # shared base first
docker compose --profile build-only build sandbox
```

Then run the harness (server + dashboard, with hot reload). These scripts live
in the `lastlight-core` package (`apps/server/`); run them with `pnpm --filter`
from anywhere in the repo:

```bash
pnpm --filter lastlight-core dev            # both server and dashboard, concurrent
pnpm --filter lastlight-core dev:server     # server only
pnpm --filter lastlight-core dev:dashboard  # dashboard only
```

Both server scripts call `apps/server/scripts/dev-local.sh`, which:
- Verifies the sandbox image exists when `LASTLIGHT_SANDBOX=docker`
- Creates `./data/agent-sessions/` and `./data/secrets/`, and bind-mounts `./data` at `/data` in docker-mode sandboxes, as the production volume is. A sandbox reads the GitHub App key from `/data/secrets/app.pem` and the OAuth logins from `/data/auth.json`
- Sets `LASTLIGHT_LOCAL_DEV=1`, `STATE_DIR=./data`, `LASTLIGHT_SESSIONS_DIR=./data/agent-sessions`
- Starts the harness with `tsx watch src/index.ts` (cwd is `apps/server/`)

#### Triggering work via the CLI

The CLI talks to the running server — it does not execute agents directly.
Install it globally, then start the server first and, in another terminal:

```bash
npm i -g lastlight

# Cheap, safe defaults — single agent invocation
lastlight owner/repo#42                            # triage that one issue
lastlight https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/42  # same, full URL form
lastlight https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/99    # review that one PR
lastlight triage owner/repo                        # scan repo for new issues to triage
lastlight review owner/repo                        # scan repo for PRs to review
lastlight health owner/repo                        # weekly health report

# Expensive, opt-in — full Architect → Executor → Reviewer → PR cycle
lastlight build owner/repo#42
lastlight build https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/42
```

> From a source checkout, swap `lastlight` for `pnpm --filter lastlight exec tsx src/cli.ts`.

The default for a single-issue/PR shorthand is the **cheap** action (triage or review). Build cycles require the explicit `build` subcommand to opt in.

Beyond triggering work, the CLI is also how you operate and debug an instance
over its admin API — no SSH:

```bash
lastlight login                   # authenticate against a server; lastlight status / whoami
lastlight workflow                # list / inspect / trigger workflow runs
lastlight session                 # tail an agent session transcript
lastlight logs                    # search the structured server logs
lastlight approvals               # list and resolve pending approval gates
lastlight cron                    # list crons, trigger one by hand
lastlight stats / activity        # spend, token counts, the activity feed
lastlight repo config validate    # check a repo's .lastlight/ config offline
lastlight facts all --repo . --base main   # deterministic diff analysis (lastlight-code-facts)
lastlight fork / pr / chat        # fork an overlay asset, PR helpers, chat
lastlight server …                # host-local lifecycle: setup/build/start/update/db
```

The full command catalogue lives in
[`packages/cli/CLAUDE.md`](packages/cli/CLAUDE.md); `lastlight --help` lists the
same set.

### Authentication

pi-ai picks credentials from the provider env vars the harness forwards (the full listed set lives in `packages/shared/src/providers.ts` — Anthropic / OpenAI / OpenRouter / Google / Mistral / Groq / Cerebras / xAI / HuggingFace / Moonshot / NVIDIA / Fireworks / Together / DeepSeek / Z.AI / Kimi / MiniMax). The harness forwards them into each sandbox container (or VM) so workflow runs can reach the API.

#### Subscription logins (OAuth) — Codex, Claude Pro, Copilot

Instead of an API key you can authenticate with a paid subscription. pi-ai
supports three OAuth providers; log in once on the host and Last Light stores
and refreshes the token for you:

```bash
lastlight oauth login openai-codex   # ChatGPT Plus/Pro (Codex)
lastlight oauth login anthropic      # Claude Pro/Max
lastlight oauth login github-copilot # GitHub Copilot
lastlight oauth list                 # providers + who's logged in
lastlight oauth status               # store path + token expiry
lastlight oauth test openai-codex    # verify a stored login refreshes
lastlight oauth logout [provider]    # remove one (or all)
```

> From a source checkout, swap `lastlight` for `pnpm --filter lastlight exec tsx src/cli.ts`.

Then point the model at that provider and restart the agent:

```bash
LASTLIGHT_MODEL=openai-codex/gpt-5.5   # Codex ids: gpt-5.5 / gpt-5.4 / gpt-5.4-mini / gpt-5.3-codex-spark
```

The login writes `auth.json` under `$STATE_DIR` (same JSON shape pi-ai's own
`npx @earendil-works/pi-ai login` writes; override with `LASTLIGHT_AUTH_FILE`).
It's **host-local** — the browser OAuth flow runs where you type the command,
so run it on the machine that runs the agent, then restart (`pnpm --filter
lastlight-core dev:server` from source, or `lastlight server restart agent` for the installed deploy) to
pick it up. Note `tsx watch` does **not** reload on `.env` changes — restart
after switching `LASTLIGHT_MODEL`.

**Reach differs by execution path.** The in-process **chat** path passes the
token as a per-call key, so all three providers work there. The **sandbox**
(agentic-pi workflow phases) reads the credential store on `gondolin`, `none`
and `docker` — the docker sandbox sees the same store as `/data/auth.json`
through its data-volume mount — so all three providers run workflows on those
backends, Codex included. The `smol` backend reads credentials from env only:
`ANTHROPIC_OAUTH_TOKEN` / `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` cover Anthropic and Copilot,
and **Codex has no env-token route, so it cannot run workflows there**. Use
another backend or an API-key provider in that case.

## Docker Deployment

The docker-compose stack is useful when you want a single `docker compose up -d` deploy. For gondolin (and a smaller deployment surface area), prefer the [native systemd deploy](#native-systemd-deploy) instead.

> **Every `docker compose` command in this section runs from `apps/server/`** —
> that's where `docker-compose.yml` lives. A production install laid out by
> `lastlight server setup` puts `instance/` next to it.

### Pull (or build) the images

The stack needs the harness image **and** the sandbox images — the latter is what
the harness spawns per phase when `LASTLIGHT_SANDBOX=docker`.

**Prebuilt — the default.** Every GitHub Release publishes
`ghcr.io/nearform/lastlight-{agent,sandbox-base,sandbox,sandbox-qa}` as *public*
packages, so `docker pull` needs no registry login. `lastlight server update`
pulls the tag your overlay's `deploy.version` pins (else `:latest`), re-tags them
to the local names the compose stack expects, restarts, and prunes superseded
versions:

```bash
lastlight server update             # pull prebuilt images, restart
lastlight server update --local     # build from source instead
lastlight server update --no-build  # just up + restart, don't touch images
```

**From source.** The sandbox services sit under the `build-only` profile, so they
are never started — only built:

```bash
cd apps/server
docker compose build agent
docker compose --profile build-only build sandbox-base   # shared base first
docker compose --profile build-only build sandbox
docker compose up -d agent
```

Set `LASTLIGHT_SANDBOX=docker` in your `instance/secrets/.env`. (Inside the harness container, gondolin's QEMU path isn't available unless you do the nested-virt setup yourself — the docker-sandbox path is the practical default for Docker deployments.)

### Deployment overlay

Everything specific to your deployment — managed repos, model/route/approval
overrides, agent-context, secrets — lives in a single **`instance/`** folder
next to `docker-compose.yml`. It's mounted read-only at `/app/instance`
(`LASTLIGHT_OVERLAY_DIR=/app/instance`) and is **never committed to the public
repo or baked into the image**, so it's the natural home for a private config
repo.

```text
instance/
  config.yaml            # overlay config — merged over the public config/default.yaml
  agent-context/*.md     # (optional) persona/rules overrides, merged by filename
  workflows/*.yaml       # (optional) add or replace workflows by logical name
  skills/<name>/SKILL.md # (optional) skill overrides
  secrets/               # host-only, gitignored: .env + GitHub App *.pem
    .env
    app.pem
```

Both `npx lastlight setup` (the config wizard) and `lastlight server setup`
scaffold this for you and then offer to **version it as a private repo** —
`git init` + an initial commit, then `gh repo create … --private --push` when
the GitHub CLI is authenticated, or the exact git/GitHub commands to run by hand
otherwise. `server setup` also lets you point at an existing overlay repo to
clone instead. To do it fully by hand:

```bash
mkdir -p instance/secrets
cp apps/server/deploy/.env.production.example instance/secrets/.env   # then fill it in
cp your-app.private-key.pem instance/secrets/app.pem
chmod 600 instance/secrets/.env instance/secrets/app.pem
# instance/config.yaml — at minimum your managed repos:
printf 'managedRepos:\n  - your-org/repo-one\n' > instance/config.yaml
```

Both the `agent` and `caddy` services read `instance/secrets/.env` via
`env_file`, and the entrypoint also sources it inside the container — so **no
repo-root `.env` is needed**. Merge rules: maps (`models`, `variants`, `routes`,
`approval`) deep-merge over the public defaults; arrays (`managedRepos`,
`disabled.*`) replace; environment variables override both. Overlay files are
read at startup — edit and `docker compose restart agent` to apply, no rebuild.
The dashboard **Config** tab shows Default / Overlay / Merged (non-secret) config
(secret-looking keys are redacted, so a stray secret in `config.yaml` won't leak).

Startup is **fail-fast**: if `LASTLIGHT_OVERLAY_DIR` is set but the folder is
missing or empty (the common "forgot to populate `instance/`" case), or a cron
targets a missing workflow, or a phase's prompt/skill can't resolve, the harness
exits `78` with a clear message instead of booting a broken instance.

### Expose Webhooks

To receive GitHub webhooks, the server needs to be publicly reachable. The included Caddy config handles HTTPS — set `DOMAIN` in `instance/secrets/.env`:

```bash
# In instance/secrets/.env:
#   DOMAIN=lastlight.example.com

# Start both agent and caddy
docker compose up -d
```

Or use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) / [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/) for testing.

### State & Monitoring

The state layer is written once and runs on **two dialects**: SQLite (via
libsql) by default, and Postgres (node-postgres or Neon) when `DATABASE_URL`
says so. Both are supported production stores — see
[`apps/server/src/state/CLAUDE.md`](apps/server/src/state/CLAUDE.md). With the
default SQLite store, all persistent state lives in a single Docker volume
(`agent-data`), mounted at `/app/data`:

```
data/
  lastlight.db              # SQLite (libsql): executions, workflow_runs, approvals, sessions …
  agent-sessions/           # Dashboard JSONL envelope store (written by event-shim.ts)
    projects/-app/*.jsonl                    # Chat sessions (one per Slack thread)
    projects/-home-agent-workspace/*.jsonl   # Sandbox-mode workflow sessions
  sandboxes/                # Cloned repos per task (gondolin or docker)
  auth.json                 # OAuth logins (lastlight oauth login); docker sandboxes read it as /data/auth.json
  logs/                     # Structured logs
  secrets/app.pem           # GitHub App PEM (mode 600) for sandbox access
```

Mount this volume or bind-mount the directory for monitoring tools to access session logs and the execution database.

On Postgres only `lastlight.db` moves out — the sessions, sandboxes and logs
directories are still on disk. `lastlight server db check` reports which store
is live, and `lastlight server db migrate` runs the one-way SQLite → Postgres
copy from inside the agent container (the `lastlight-state` bin ships in the
image, since the CLI may never gain an edge to core).

### Trigger Work via CLI

With the container running:

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8644/health

# Trigger a build cycle
lastlight https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/42

# Trigger triage
lastlight triage owner/repo
```

## Native (systemd) Deploy

For a Linux production host with KVM available (`/dev/kvm`), the native deploy runs the harness directly under systemd and uses gondolin for sandboxing — no Docker required.

See [apps/server/deploy/native/README.md](apps/server/deploy/native/README.md) for the full runbook. The short version:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nearform/lastlight.git /opt/lastlight
cd /opt/lastlight/apps/server
# (optional) install -m 0600 -o root /path/to/app.pem /etc/lastlight/app.pem
sudo bash deploy/native/install.sh        # scaffolds /etc/lastlight/lastlight.env
sudo $EDITOR /etc/lastlight/lastlight.env # fill in secrets
sudo bash deploy/native/install.sh        # second run: starts the service
```

Re-deploys: `git pull && sudo bash deploy/native/install.sh` (idempotent — rebuilds and restarts the service), from `apps/server/`.

**Required:** the host kernel must expose `/dev/kvm` (bare-metal Linux or KVM-enabled VM). Hetzner Cloud, Cloud Run, Fly Machines (without `--vm-cpu-class shared`), and most managed container hosts do **not** expose nested virt — see `packages/agentic-pi/SPIKE-gondolin.md` for the full constraint matrix.

If KVM isn't available, fall back to the Docker deploy above with `LASTLIGHT_SANDBOX=docker`.

## Setup Details

### 1. Create a GitHub App

1. Go to **https://github.com/settings/apps/new**
2. Fill in:
   - **Name**: your bot name (appears on comments/PRs with a `[bot]` badge)
   - **Homepage URL**: your repo URL
   - **Webhook URL**: `https://your-domain:8644/webhooks/github` (or leave blank for now)
   - **Webhook Secret**: a random string (same as `WEBHOOK_SECRET` in `.env`)
3. Set **permissions**:
   - **Issues**: Read & Write
   - **Pull Requests**: Read & Write
   - **Contents**: Read & Write
   - **Checks**: Read & Write (post the `last-light/review` check; receive its "Re-run" requests)
   - **Commit statuses**: Read (classic CI statuses — CircleCI, Jenkins, other external CI. Separate from **Checks**; without it CI is judged on check runs alone)
   - **Metadata**: Read
4. Subscribe to **events**: `Issues`, `Pull request`, `Issue comment`, `Check run`, `Check suite` (the last two enable the GitHub "Re-run checks" buttons to re-trigger a review)
5. Click **Create GitHub App**
6. Click **Generate a private key** — save the `.pem` file into the project directory
7. Note the **App ID** from the app settings page
8. Click **Install App** → install on your repos
9. Note the **Installation ID** from the URL: `github.com/settings/installations/{ID}`

### 2. Environment Variables

Legacy `OPENCODE_*` names are still read as fallbacks for the corresponding `LASTLIGHT_*` names, so existing `.env` files from the OpenCode era keep working.

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `GITHUB_APP_ID` | Yes | GitHub App ID |
| `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` | Yes | Path to `.pem` file |
| `GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID` | Yes | Installation ID |
| `WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Yes | GitHub webhook signature secret |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | One of | API key for an `openai/…` model |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | One of | API key for an `anthropic/…` model |

| `FIREWORKS_API_KEY` | One of | API key for `fireworks/…` |
| `TOGETHER_API_KEY` | One of | API key for `together/…` |
| `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` | One of | API key for `deepseek/…` |
| `ZAI_API_KEY` | One of | API key for `zai/…` (GLM) |
| `KIMI_API_KEY` | One of | API key for `kimi-coding/…` |
| `MINIMAX_API_KEY` | One of | API key for `minimax/…` |
| _… or any other `provider/model` whose key is forwarded by `packages/shared/src/providers.ts`_ | | The wizard surfaces the registered set; see `packages/shared/src/providers.ts` for the full list. |
| `LASTLIGHT_OVERLAY_DIR` | No | Trusted deployment overlay directory (the docker-compose stack mounts `instance/` here as `/app/instance`). Startup loads `config/default.yaml`, optional `$LASTLIGHT_OVERLAY_DIR/config.yaml`, then env overrides; overlay assets under `workflows/`, `workflows/prompts/`, `skills/`, and `agent-context/` replace built-ins. Secrets live in `$LASTLIGHT_OVERLAY_DIR/secrets/`. Restart required after changes. See [Deployment overlay](#deployment-overlay). |
| `LASTLIGHT_MODEL` | No | Default model (default: `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6`). Legacy: `OPENCODE_MODEL`. |
| `LASTLIGHT_MODELS` | No | Per-task model overrides as JSON, e.g. `{"chat":"openai/gpt-5.1-mini","architect":"openai/gpt-5.5"}`. Legacy: `OPENCODE_MODELS`. |
| `LASTLIGHT_THINKING` | No | Reasoning-effort default (`off` \| `minimal` \| `low` \| `medium` \| `high` \| `xhigh`). pi-ai translates per-provider. Legacy: `OPENCODE_VARIANT`. |
| `LASTLIGHT_THINKINGS` | No | Per-task thinking-level overrides as JSON, e.g. `{"architect":"high","reviewer":"high","triage":"minimal"}`. Legacy: `OPENCODE_VARIANTS`. |
| `LASTLIGHT_SANDBOX` | No | Workflow sandbox backend: `gondolin` (default) \| `docker` \| `none`. |
| `LASTLIGHT_OTEL_ENABLED` | No | Enable OpenTelemetry export (default: `false`). Standard `OTEL_*` env vars alone do not enable telemetry. |
| `LASTLIGHT_OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` | No | OTEL service name (default: `lastlight`; falls back to `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`). |
| `LASTLIGHT_OTEL_INCLUDE_CONTENT` | No | Include prompts/message/tool-result content in telemetry (default: `false`; sensitive, use carefully). |
| `LASTLIGHT_OTEL_FORWARD_TO_SANDBOX` | No | Forward sandbox telemetry to the backend (default: `true`). On the `docker` backend this routes through an in-network OTEL collector; on `gondolin`/`none` it forwards allowlisted `OTEL_*` env vars directly. |
| `LASTLIGHT_OTEL_STRICT` | No | Throw on OTEL initialization/export setup failure instead of warn-and-continue (default: `false`). |
| `LASTLIGHT_OTEL_COLLECTOR_HOSTS` | No | Comma-separated collector hostnames added to the strict sandbox egress allowlist. Used only by the `gondolin` backend (the `docker` backend reaches its collector internally and ignores this). |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_*_ENDPOINT` | No | Standard OTLP HTTP collector endpoints. Used by the harness directly, and by the in-network collector as its re-export target on the `docker` backend. |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_*_HEADERS` | No | Standard OTLP headers; secret/env-only and never shown in public config. |
| `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`, `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` | No | Standard OTEL resource configuration. |
| `LASTLIGHT_SESSIONS_DIR` | No | Where the dashboard reads sessions (default: `$STATE_DIR/agent-sessions`). |
| `PORT` / `WEBHOOK_PORT` | No | Webhook listener port (default: `8644`) |
| `STATE_DIR` | No | Persistent state directory (default: `./data`) |
| `DB_PATH` | No | SQLite path (default: `$STATE_DIR/lastlight.db`). Ignored when `DATABASE_URL` is set. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | No | Postgres connection string. Set it and the whole state layer runs on Postgres (node-postgres, or Neon for a `neon.tech` host) instead of SQLite. Secret — belongs in `instance/secrets/.env`, never in `config.yaml`. See [`src/state/CLAUDE.md`](apps/server/src/state/CLAUDE.md). |
| `MAX_TURNS` | No | Reserved (kept for API stability) |
| `BOT_LOGIN` | No | Bot login name for self-event filtering (default: `last-light[bot]`) |
| `LASTLIGHT_LOCAL_DEV` | No | Set to `1` on dev machines to skip `git config --global` writes from `git-auth.ts`. The installation token still reaches sandboxes via `GIT_TOKEN`. |
| `SANDBOX_DATA_VOLUME` | No | Used only when `LASTLIGHT_SANDBOX=docker`. Either a Docker named volume (default: `lastlight_agent-data`) or a host path (`/`, `./`, `../`, `~`) to bind-mount as `/data` inside each sandbox. Local dev uses `./data`, the state dir. |

### OpenTelemetry export

OpenTelemetry is disabled by default. Set `LASTLIGHT_OTEL_ENABLED=true` and configure standard OTEL exporter env vars such as `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`, and `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` to export harness spans/metrics for workflow runs, phases, agent executions, PI event streams, and chat turns.

By default Last Light exports metadata only: workflow/phase names, repo, sandbox backend, model, success/stop reason, timing, tokens, and cost. Prompt text, message content, tool arguments, and tool outputs are redacted unless `LASTLIGHT_OTEL_INCLUDE_CONTENT=true`; that opt-in can export sensitive data and should only be used with a trusted collector.

When `LASTLIGHT_OTEL_FORWARD_TO_SANDBOX=true` (default), `agentic-pi` workflow sandboxes emit their own telemetry too. How it reaches the backend depends on the sandbox backend:

- **`docker` (production):** sandboxes export OTLP to an **in-network OTEL collector** (a `otel-collector` compose service on the `sandbox-egress` network, reached by a fixed internal IP). That collector re-exports to your real backend over its own outbound network leg. This means the sandbox only ever dials one fixed internal endpoint — collectors on any port or scheme (e.g. `https://collector:4318`) work without special egress rules, and the backend endpoint and auth headers (`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`) stay host-side and are **never** forwarded into the untrusted sandbox. The collector cannot be redirected by sandbox traffic, so it adds no SSRF/exfil surface.
- **`gondolin` / `none`:** `agentic-pi` runs in the harness process and already inherits the harness OTEL SDK. Allowlisted `OTEL_*` env vars are forwarded into the sandbox shell env directly; `gondolin` adds collector hosts (parsed from `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, signal-specific endpoint env vars, and `LASTLIGHT_OTEL_COLLECTOR_HOSTS`) to its egress allowlist. Private/internal metadata hosts remain blocked.

Set `LASTLIGHT_OTEL_FORWARD_TO_SANDBOX=false` to disable sandbox telemetry entirely and keep collector endpoints/headers in the harness only.

### 3. Managed Repositories

The public `config/default.yaml` ships an **empty** `managedRepos` list — set
yours in the overlay (`instance/config.yaml`), which replaces the list wholesale:

```yaml
managedRepos:
  - your-org/repo-one
  - your-org/repo-two
```

Webhooks for repos not in this list are filtered at the connector level; Slack/CLI
commands targeting unmanaged repos are rejected. Install the GitHub App on each.

### 4. Customize Behaviour

Put deployment-specific changes in your overlay (`instance/`) instead of editing
packaged files — that keeps your config out of the public repo and applies on a
restart (no rebuild). See [Deployment overlay](#deployment-overlay) for the full
model and layout.

```text
instance/
  config.yaml                 # non-secret config overrides only
  workflows/*.yaml            # add/replace workflows by logical `name`
  workflows/prompts/*.md      # prompt overrides/fallbacks
  skills/<name>/SKILL.md      # skill overrides/fallbacks
  agent-context/*.md          # merged by filename; overlay replaces built-ins
  secrets/                    # host-only, gitignored: .env + *.pem
```

The dashboard Config tab shows Default / Overlay / Merged non-secret config.
Overlay files are read at startup only; `docker compose restart agent` after changes.

| What | Where |
|------|-------|
| Managed repos, routes, models, variants, approvals, disables | overlay `instance/config.yaml` (over `config/default.yaml`) |
| Bot personality & communication style | `agent-context/soul.md` or overlay `instance/agent-context/` |
| Operational rules, review guidelines, triage rules | `agent-context/rules.md` or overlay `instance/agent-context/` |
| Skill definitions | `skills/*/SKILL.md` or overlay `instance/skills/` |
| Workflow phases (Architect/Executor/Reviewer/PR) | `workflows/*.yaml` + `workflows/prompts/` or overlay equivalents |
| Cron job schedules | `workflows/cron-*.yaml` or overlay workflows |

## Claude Code skills

Last Light ships a [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code)
**plugin** that teaches Claude Code how to install, configure and operate Last
Light for you. Install the skills, then in a Claude Code session just ask — e.g.
*"set up a Last Light server"*, *"connect my CLI to my server"*, *"fork the build
workflow into my overlay"*, or *"scaffold a Last Light evals workspace"*.

| Skill | Use it when you want to… |
|-------|--------------------------|
| `lastlight-guide` | Orientation & router — you're not sure which of the others you need. |
| `lastlight-server` | Install & configure a Last Light server (agent + docker stack). |
| `lastlight-client` | Point the `lastlight` CLI at a server and log in. |
| `lastlight-overlay` | Create a deployment overlay and fork workflows/prompts/skills/persona. |
| `lastlight-debug` | Debug a failed or stuck run on a deployed instance over the admin API (no SSH). |
| `lastlight-evals` | Scaffold & run a Last Light Evals workspace (datasets, models, comparisons). |
| `lastlight-evals-loop` | Drive an eval toward a score target with an anti-gaming improvement loop. |

Install them with the CLI (version-matched to the installed `lastlight`, works
offline — uses the `claude` plugin marketplace when present, else copies the
skills into `~/.claude/skills`):

```bash
lastlight skills install                 # → ~/.claude/skills (user scope)
lastlight skills install --scope project # → ./.claude/skills (this repo only)
lastlight skills list                    # show bundled skills + where they're installed
lastlight skills uninstall
```

Or register the marketplace directly — this repo root is itself a Claude Code
marketplace (from a checkout, or straight from GitHub):

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add ./                 # from a local checkout
claude plugin marketplace add nearform/lastlight # or straight from GitHub
claude plugin install lastlight@lastlight-skills
```

The plugin lives at the repo root — `plugins/lastlight/` (manifest in
`.claude-plugin/`). The published `lastlight` CLI stages a copy into its own
package at build (`packages/cli/scripts/copy-plugin.mjs`) so `lastlight skills
install` works offline after a global install. These are *Claude Code* skills —
distinct from Last Light's internal sandbox skills in `apps/server/skills/`.

### How Events Flow

1. **GitHub webhook** → connector verifies signature, filters noise (bot events, edits, labels), normalizes to `EventEnvelope`
2. **Router** maps event type to skill deterministically (no LLM in the routing loop):
   - `issue.opened` → `issue-triage`
   - `pr.opened` → `pr-review`
   - `comment.created` with `@last-light` from a maintainer → routed by intent classifier (build / explore / question / triage / review / security / verify / qa-test / demo)
3. **Workflow runner** loads the matching YAML, dispatches each phase to `executeAgent` (`src/engine/agent-executor.ts`, which invokes agentic-pi) or, for chat, `ChatRunner` (`src/engine/chat/chat-runner.ts`, in-process pi-ai)
4. **Build workflow** (`workflows/build.yaml`) runs a multi-phase cycle:
   - **Context** (`phase_0`) — gathers the issue/repo context the later phases read
   - **Guardrails · setup** — the agent works out install/typecheck/lint and names the repo's full test command, writing it to `.git/lastlight-gate.sh` (inside `.git`, so it is never committed). It does *not* run the suite.
   - **Guardrails · gate** — a deterministic `bash` phase that runs that script **once**; the exit code is the verdict, so READY can only mean the full suite exited 0
   - **Architect** — read-only analysis, writes plan to `.lastlight/issue-N/architect-plan.md`
   - **Executor** — TDD implementation following the plan
   - **Reviewer** — independent verification (no shared context with executor), with a **fix loop** of up to 2 cycles if it requests changes
   - **Create PR**

### Cron

Most cron jobs run **regardless of webhooks**. Only issue triage is
webhook-gated. The review and autonomy sweeps deliberately carry no `condition:`
— they are the backstop for work that stranded or for an event that never
arrived, which is precisely the failure webhooks cannot self-heal. Don't disable
them because webhooks are on.

| Job | Workflow | Schedule | Condition |
|-----|----------|----------|-----------|
| Triage new issues | `cron-triage.yaml` | Every 15 min | Only without webhooks |
| Check PRs awaiting review | `cron-review.yaml` | Every 30 min | Always — the stranded-review backstop |
| Pick up ready issues (autonomy) | `cron-autonomy.yaml` | Every 20 min | Always |
| Merge green dependency PRs | `cron-dependabot-merge.yaml` | Daily 14:00 | Always |
| Fix red dependency PRs | `cron-dependabot-ci-fix.yaml` | Daily 15:00 | Always |
| Weekly health report | `cron-health.yaml` | Mondays 9am | Always |
| Weekly repo digest → Slack | `cron-digest.yaml` | Mondays 9am | Always, but inert until a channel resolves for the repo |
| Weekly security scan | `cron-security.yaml` | Mondays 10am | Always |

Core internals that used to sit at the repo root (`src/`, `workflows/`,
`skills/`, `agent-context/`, `deploy/`, `config/`, `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`,
`Caddyfile`, `spec/`) now live under `apps/server/`.

## Troubleshooting

### Installing the CLI

`npm i -g lastlight` installs the **lean** `lastlight` package (`packages/cli/`).
It's a thin client + host-local `server` lifecycle and carries none of the
server's native or AI dependencies (no `better-sqlite3`, no `@google/genai`), so
the install is fast and free of the transitive-deprecation noise those deps used
to print. The heavy runtime lives in `lastlight-core` (`apps/server/`) and is
installed on the host separately (the docker stack or `lastlight server` build).

### Server won't start

```bash
# Check .env is loaded
pnpm --filter lastlight-core dev:server
# Look for "Required environment variable not set" errors
```

### `pnpm --filter lastlight-core dev` says the sandbox image is missing (docker-sandbox mode)

```bash
cd apps/server   # the compose file lives in the server package
docker compose --profile build-only build sandbox-base   # shared base first
docker compose --profile build-only build sandbox
```

### Workflow run fails with `exit 127: sh: 1: agentic-pi: not found`

The sandbox image needs `agentic-pi` baked in. Rebuild it:

```bash
cd apps/server   # the compose file lives in the server package
docker compose --profile build-only build sandbox-base   # shared base first
docker compose --profile build-only build sandbox
```

If you're on an old `lastlight-sandbox:latest`, this picks up the install step that the current `sandbox.Dockerfile` performs.

### Workflow hangs forever with no output (gondolin mode on a host without KVM)

Gondolin requires `/dev/kvm` on Linux or HVF on macOS. Inside a container with no nested virt, `VM.create()` succeeds but the first `vm.exec()` hangs. Symptoms: phase shows "running" indefinitely with no JSONL events after `sandbox_status`.

Either switch to `LASTLIGHT_SANDBOX=docker` (sibling containers via socket) or move the harness to a KVM-capable host. Full analysis: `packages/agentic-pi/SPIKE-gondolin.md`.

### Agent run fails with a quota / billing error

The runtime surfaces upstream errors as `error_api` with the verbatim provider message in the executions row:

- OpenAI: "Quota exceeded. Check your plan and billing details." → top up at https://platform.openai.com/account/billing
- Anthropic: "Credit balance is too low" → top up at https://console.anthropic.com

### Chat replies fail with `error_error`

Check the agent logs for the underlying error — common causes:

- **Wrong key for the chat model.** `LASTLIGHT_MODELS={"chat":"anthropic/…"}` but no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set. Fix the override or add the key.
- **Model id typo.** Watch for `[config] Model: …` in startup logs to confirm what's actually loaded.

### Webhooks not arriving

```bash
# Check health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8644/health

# Test with a fake POST (should return 401 — invalid signature)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8644/webhooks/github -d '{}'

# Check Docker port mapping
docker compose ps
```
