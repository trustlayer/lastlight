// ── `findings` — the conservation gate's view of `findings.json` ─────────────

/**
 * `.lastlight/pr-review/findings.json`, as far as the WP6c **conservation
 * gate** cares — and no further
 * (`docs/plans/deterministic-pr-levers.md` §"Adjudication and the attention
 * boundary (WP6)").
 *
 * Two properties are deliberate and both are load-bearing.
 *
 * **It is LOOSE, everywhere.** The document's real contract lives in
 * `apps/server/skills/pr-review/references/findings-schema.md` and the
 * adjudicator writes a superset of it — `mechanism`, `bothEnds`, `evidence`,
 * `suggestion`, whatever WP7 adds next. `post-review` passes unknown fields
 * through untouched, so a schema here that STRIPPED them would turn the §D12
 * floor's rewrite into silent data loss: the gate would delete the evidence
 * packet in the act of preserving the finding. Hence `looseObject` at every
 * level, and hence `--repair` mutating the object it parsed from disk rather
 * than the one zod handed back.
 *
 * **It is thin.** Everything the gate does not use is optional, because a
 * second, weaker copy of `findings-schema.md` living in this package is drift
 * waiting to happen — and because a validator that rejects a document for a
 * missing `summary` would fail the loop for a reason that has nothing to do
 * with conservation. What it DOES pin is the shape the gate reads: `findings`
 * and `dropped` are arrays if they are present at all.
