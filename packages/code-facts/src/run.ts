/**
 * Orchestration — one envelope per document, and the tier arithmetic that keeps
 * "clean" and "blind" apart.
 *
 * `coverage` is derived, never asserted by an extractor:
 *
 *   degraded[] empty        → "full"      → exit 0
 *   degraded[] populated    → "degraded"  → exit 3
 *   the run threw           → "none"      → exit 2  (and the wrapper turns that
 *                                                    into an envelope + exit 0)
 *
 * So there is exactly one way to produce an empty result that looks trustworthy
 * — an extractor that genuinely found nothing with every input available — and
 * every other path carries a written reason.
 *
 * ## ONE ENGINE
 *
 * `facts`, `contracts` and `constants` all run on the tsgo snapshot
 * (`tsgo.ts` + `tsgo-extractors.ts`). There is no `--engine`, no dual path and
 * no fallback to a second compiler, and that is a correctness decision rather
 * than a tidiness one: **two engines means two type PRINTERS**, and a signature
 * that prints differently on one side is the asymmetry that produced WP1's 227
 * contract deltas of which exactly one was real.
 *
 * ## ONE SNAPSHOT, TWO VIEWS, AND THE BASE ONE GOES FIRST
 *
 * The base side is an OVERLAY over the same tree rather than a
 * `git worktree add` into `$TMPDIR`. Two of the three phantom-delta causes die
 * with that: the two sides cannot disagree about the project layout (one
 * argument list, used twice) and they cannot disagree about `node_modules`
 * (one tree). What is left is the printer, which `contracts.ts` canonicalises.
 *
 * The two views are two `tsgo` children of ~600 MB each on this repo, and they
 * are never alive at the same time: a `Shape` is strings, so the base view is
 * drained to plain data and DISPOSED before the head view opens.

 * than the engine this replaced. A `Shape` is strings, so the base side is
 * drained to plain data and disposed first; the peak becomes one child.
 *
 * Two failure modes are handled here rather than left to the extractors:
 *
 *  - **A tsconfig that will not PARSE is not one that is absent.** Its files
 *    are ABANDONED — refused by `lookup` — rather than routed to tsgo's
 *    inferred project, or a repository whose build config is broken is silently
 *    promoted to tier 1 under default compiler options.
 *  - **Tier 2 is "no analysable changed file is in any program"**, not "no
 *    project loaded". `openFiles` means there is nearly always an inferred
 *    project, so counting projects would report tier 1 for a run that saw
 *    nothing.
