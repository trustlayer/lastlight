/**
 * The unit survey's RESPONSE — what one bounded, non-agentic model call per
 * unit must hand back, and how `units-ingest` reads it.
 *
 * ── Why the schema lives here ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The request (`units.ts`) states this shape and the ingest validates against
 * it, so both halves are one module's constants. Core only does the model I/O:
 * its one check is {@link findUnitObject} + {@link isUsableUnitReply} — the
 * same two rules ingest applies, mirrored there case for case — enough to
 * decide its single retry and whether to cache; everything past that is
 * decided here, deterministically and testably without a model.
 *
 * ── What is deliberately NOT in it ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * No `severity`, no `needsProbe`, no discharge code. All three are DERIVED from
 * the evidence record by `survey-verdict.ts`, exactly as they are for an agent
 * survey's rows — asking for a judgement made the answer depend on the
 * adjectives a prompt used, and identical evidence must rank identically
 * whichever engine wrote the row.
 *
 * The evidence record is the `survey-pass` skill's, field for field, typed
 * STRICTLY: a unit reply is a single JSON object a machine reads, so a value
 * outside the type is a defect in that entry rather than a spelling to guess
 * at. What ingest does with a defective entry is its business (it keeps the
 * claim and routes the row to a probe) — never a silent drop.

// ── Finding the reply object: THE canonical rule ────────────────────────────
//
// Two sides read a unit reply and they must agree on what counts as one: the
// core handler (`apps/server/src/workflows/handlers/survey-units.ts`) decides
// its single retry, and whether to cache, off it; `units-ingest` decides
// `ok` / `invalid` off it. When they disagreed — the handler tried every `{`,
// ingest stopped at the first unclosed one — a reply the handler accepted and
// cached could read `invalid` at ingest forever (a cached reading is never
// re-asked). So the rule lives HERE, specified by the two doc comments below
// and pinned by `tests/unit-reply.test.ts`, whose case table the handler's
// test copies verbatim. Change one side and the tables diverge.

 *      unclosed `{` (a truncated reply, a stray brace in prose) is skipped and
 *      the scan continues from the next character; so is a balanced span that
 *      is not JSON.
 *   2. The FIRST candidate whose `unitId` is exactly `unitId` (string
 *      equality, no normalisation) is the reply.
 *   3. Otherwise, one level of nesting: for each candidate in order, each
 *      property value that is an object whose `unitId` is `unitId`, or an
 *      object element with that `unitId` of a property value that is an array.
 *      The first found is the reply (`{"result":{"unitId":"u-001",…}}`).
 *   4. Otherwise `null` — including when objects exist but none names this
 *      unit. An object naming ANOTHER unit is never this unit's reply.
 *
 * It does not validate the body; {@link isUsableUnitReply} is the structural
 * check applied to what this returns, and the schema is ingest's.
