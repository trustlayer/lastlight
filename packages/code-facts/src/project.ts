/**
 * Paths, languages and the `languages[]` census — **and no compiler at all.**
 *
 * This file used to be 1,247 lines of ts-morph `Project` construction plus the
 * cost management that made it survivable: a total file budget shared out
 * between groups, a project cap, a neighbourhood selector, a glob fallback, a
 * per-project source index. All of it is gone
 * (`docs/plans/fact-engine/02-migration.md`), because every number it managed
 * was a ts-morph number. `src/tsgo.ts` opens every tsconfig the diff touches in
 * ONE snapshot whose closure lives in the Go child, so there is no budget to
 * allocate and nothing to narrow.
 *
 * What survives is everything that was never about the compiler: which
 * extensions are analysable, which paths are tests, which are not worth
 * scanning, which language a file belongs to, and the envelope's `languages[]`
 * row. `compilerInfo()` survives too, re-pointed at the compiler that actually
 * runs — see `src/tsgo.ts`.
 *
 * **Rule 2 of the old TS 7 landmine is the one that did not expire: never
 * resolve `typescript` from the repo under review.** `tests/compiler-isolation.test.ts`
 * is the gate, and it now additionally asserts that the copy which DID resolve
 * is the exact-pinned one in this package's own dependency tree.
