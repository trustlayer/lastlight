/**
 * The unit assembler — `lastlight-facts units`.
 *
 * Cuts a pull request into UNITS and renders, for each, the complete request a
 * single bounded, non-agentic model call receives (see
 * `docs/plans/pr-review-units-sites.md`). The five-branch agent survey spent minutes per
 * branch re-deriving with bash the context `facts`/`seed` had already computed;
 * this prints that context instead, once, per unit.
 *
 *   - one `symbol` unit per changed function or method (the OUTERMOST
 *     function-like declaration containing a changed line — a class is not a
 *     unit, its methods are);
 *   - at most one `module` unit per FILE, carrying every changed region no
 *     symbol unit holds (imports, constants, types, top-level statements,
 *     non-code files), in order, with an elision row between regions — split
 *     into several units only when the budget forces it;
 *   - small changed functions (≤ `SMALL_SYMBOL_LINES`, no obligation) folded
 *     into that module unit as whole regions, keeping their callers/callees;
 *   - one `pr` unit for the obligations no unit in the diff could hold;
 *   - a unit owning more than `FAMILY_SPLIT_CHANGED_LINES` changed lines is
 *     surveyed once PER FAMILY — one unit per asked family, each with only
 *     that family's question and obligations.
 *
 * Spec obligations (core's `spec-obligations.json` — acceptance criteria whose
 * second end is a list of candidate FILES) ride on the unit with the most
 * touched lines in their first candidate file that has one; see `attachSpec`.
 *
 * Every request is the run-constant `UNITS_SHARED_PREFIX` followed by the
 * unit-specific part, so a provider's prefix cache pays for the common ~6k
 * characters once per run rather than once per unit.
 *
 * ── The file set and the text come from GIT ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The package rule (CLAUDE.md, "the file set comes from git"): every source
 * line shown is read from the HEAD COMMIT (`git show <headSha>:<path>`), never
 * the working tree, and the changed lines come from ONE `git diff` over the
 * same merge-base range every other extractor uses — so a tag in a request is
 * a claim about `headSha`, not about whatever the checkout holds. `facts.json`
 * is read for its shas and for ENRICHMENT only (reference sites, callees): a
 * tier-3 envelope with no symbols still yields a unit for every changed line.
 *
 * ── Deterministic, and loud about what it cut ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * Units are ordered by file, then line; ids are `u-NNN` in that order (a
 * family sibling `u-NNN-<family>`);
 * `requestSha256` is the sha256 of the exact request. Each request is held to a
 * character budget by a shrink cascade — trim neighbours, drop neighbours,
 * spread a module unit's regions over several units, split a long unit into
 * overlapping passes — and every step that fires marks
 * the unit `truncated` and names itself in `degraded[]`.
