 * `lastlight-facts` — the deterministic layer, on a command line.
 *
 * Also reachable as `lastlight facts …`: `code-facts` ships INSIDE the
 * `lastlight` CLI (design review §D1), because the eval harness defaults to
 * `--sandbox none` — in-process, on the host — and no eval configuration on a
 * Mac can see `/opt/lastlight/`. An image-only toolchain would be unmeasurable,
 * and a rung nobody can measure is a rung nobody can defend.
 *
 * `console.*` is correct HERE and nowhere else in this package: this file is a
 * terminal entry point, and every module it calls takes an injected
 * `LoggerPort` instead.

const USAGE = `lastlight-facts — deterministic program-analysis facts about a pull request

Usage:
  lastlight-facts <command> --repo <dir> --base <ref> --head <ref> [options]

Commands:
  facts       changed symbols + the impact cone (references, tests, callees)
  contracts   exported-signature delta, base vs head, + consumers outside the diff
  constants   references MINUS literals — the hard-coded-duplicate subtraction
  deps        manifest delta, import sites, optional staged source
  patterns    opengrep + gitleaks, scoped to the diff (probed on PATH)
  coverage    changed lines executed by zero tests, from an EXISTING report
  all         every extractor, one envelope, one file
  seed        turn an \`all\` envelope into mechanism-complete obligations
  prepare     install deps so a probe can be RUN (WP4's affordance, not CI)
  discharge   a SURVEY's exit gate — every obligation of one family carries a
              QUOTE / ABSENT / PARTIAL / PROBE discharge in its .jsonl. First
              writes each row's canonical id into its \`id\` (the survey's own
              label kept as \`declared_id\`). \`--ungraded\` for a family whose
              obligations are not on disk (\`spec\`): the id rewrite plus a
              non-empty-file check
  probes      the \`falsify\` loop's exit gate — every hypothesis that needed a
              probe has a verdict, and every claim of execution has a transcript
              that OPENS with the command it ran
  findings    the \`adjudicate\` loop's exit gate — the CONSERVATION check: every
              hypothesis has exactly one disposition, and every deletion names a
              transcript that exists
  dossier     the \`adjudicate\` phase's INPUT — every hypothesis, probe verdict,
              transcript and conservation row joined into one document, with
              every quote already checked against the tree
  jev-classify  #399 idea 2 — one TypeSafe System-One call PER HYPOTHESIS
              asking the category axis, written for \`dossier\` to render as an
              ADVISORY annotation. Never decides; never fails the run.
  toolchain   print the pinned manifest and what actually resolved

\`discharge\` options (WP3 — it replaces \`test -s\`, which one line of any content
passes; it reads no quote and judges no claim):
  --dir <dir>         the .lastlight/pr-review directory
                      (default: .lastlight/pr-review)
  --family <f>        the survey branch's family                   (required)
  --ledger            print the CHECKLIST instead of grading: every obligation
                      of the family, \`[x]\`/\`[ ]\`, with its question. For the
                      SURVEY to run. Reports; never grades — ALWAYS exits 0.
  Exit 0 = every obligation carries one of QUOTE / ABSENT / PARTIAL / PROBE (or
  there were none, or the family is NOT MEASURED). 3 = the file exists and
  something is outstanding. 2 = there was nothing to grade — no
  hypotheses/<family>.jsonl at all, no readable obligations.json, or a --family
  the document does not name. ANY non-zero means "iterate again".

\`probes\` options (a near-existence gate, not a validator — it reads a
transcript's FIRST LINE and nothing else):
  --dir <dir>         the .lastlight/pr-review directory
                      (default: .lastlight/pr-review)
  --repo <dir>        what a transcript path is relative to (default: cwd)
  A \`reproduced\`/\`corroborated\`/\`refuted\` verdict must name a \`command\` and a
  transcript that exists and opens with that command — \`"command": "code
  inspection"\` over a page of prose is \`unexecuted\`, not evidence. A
  \`reproduced\` whose every command only READS code (grep/rg/cat/…, a facts
  query) against a claim whose evidence records a consequence at head is
  \`read-not-reproduction\`: record it \`corroborated\`, or run something.
  \`unprobed\` needs nothing and always closes the gate.
  Exit 0 = the loop may stop. Non-zero = something still owes a verdict, which
  a pass can always discharge honestly by recording \`unprobed\`.

\`findings\` options (conservation, not schema validation — WP6c):
  --dir <dir>         the .lastlight/pr-review directory
                      (default: .lastlight/pr-review)
  --repo <dir>        what a \`refutedBy\` path is relative to (default: cwd)
  --repair            the §D12 FLOOR. Record every unaccounted hypothesis at
                      tier "internal", un-delete every drop with no transcript,
                      rewrite findings.json and exit 0. Idempotent, and it never
                      deletes: an unjustified deletion becomes a recorded
                      non-deletion. Run it on the LAST iteration. It then
                      DERIVES every hypothesis-derived finding's severity from
                      the evidence record and probe strength, keeping the
                      written value as \`declaredSeverity\`.
  --ledger            print the CHECKLIST instead of grading: every declared id
                      by family, which already carry a disposition, and which do
                      not. For the ADJUDICATOR to run, so it discharges an
                      explicit list rather than reconstructing one from six
                      .jsonl files. Reports; never grades — ALWAYS exits 0.
  Exit 0 = the loop may stop. Non-zero = a hypothesis is unaccounted for, a
  deletion has nothing to show for it, or there is no readable findings.json.

\`dossier\` options (it reads the pipeline's own artifacts; no --base/--head):
  --dir <dir>         the .lastlight/pr-review directory
                      (default: .lastlight/pr-review)
  --repo <dir>        what a quote path and a transcript path are relative to
                      (default: cwd)
  --out <file>        write the dossier here                   (default: stdout)
  --transcript-chars <n>  cap on an inlined probe transcript   (default: 4000).
                      Truncation is always announced with the path.
  --json              the structured rows behind the Markdown, keyed by
                      hypothesis id — for a consumer that reads one row per
                      hypothesis rather than a document meant for a model
  Always exits 0. Its consumer is the harness, which attaches the result to the
  phase — a missing artifact is a thinner dossier that SAYS so, never a failure
  that strands the phase with nothing.

\`jev-classify\` options (annotates the dossier; decides nothing):
  --dir <dir>         the .lastlight/pr-review directory
                      (default: .lastlight/pr-review)
  --repo <dir>        what a quote path is relative to        (default: cwd)
  --model <id>        the TypeSafe model                (default: jev-latest)
  --concurrency <n>   parallel systemOne calls                     (default: 8)
  --out <file>        write jev.json here    (default: .lastlight/pr-review/jev.json)
  Needs TYPESAFE_KEY (or TYPESAFE_API_KEY). Always exits 0 — a missing key, a
  network error, or a malformed answer writes a document that SAYS so (an
  \`error\`, per hypothesis or for the whole run) rather than failing the phase.

\`prepare\` options (it acts on a tree; no --base/--head, and it runs no analysis):
  --repo <dir>        the checkout to prepare               (default: cwd)
  --out <file>        write env.json here                   (default: stdout)
  --no-install        don't install, just report what is already there
  --lifecycle-scripts allow the tree's own postinstall to run. OFF by default:
                      this runs against a PR HEAD, so that is the author's code
                      executing on the operator's machine
  --typecheck         run the repo's own tsc --noEmit for per-line diagnostics
                      (NOT a CI re-run — CI reports pass/fail, this reports
                      something a hypothesis can be anchored to)
  --coverage          run a coverage command so the \`tests\` family has an input.
                      The one step that runs a test suite; opt-in for that reason
  --coverage-cmd <s>  explicit coverage command (beats package.json detection)
  --install-timeout <ms> / --typecheck-timeout <ms> / --coverage-timeout <ms>

\`seed\` options (it reads a DOCUMENT, not a repo — no --base/--head):
  --facts <file>      the \`all\` document to seed from            (required)
  --out <file>        write obligations.json here                (default: stdout)
  --blocks <dir>      also write one rendered block per family, \`<family>.md\`
  --max-obligations <n>  TOTAL backstop (default 48). Truncation is per-FAMILY
                      first — contract 12, enforcement 12, state 8, security 8,
                      tests 8 — because each family feeds one survey branch, so
                      the cost is per branch and one family's excess must never
                      unask another's questions. This bound is applied after
                      those ceilings and, at the default (their sum), cannot
                      bind. Every drop is counted in the document, naming the
                      ceiling or the backstop — never silent.
  --contract <mode>   which obligation BLOCK the families get: \`full\` (default —
                      the mandatory discharge contract, the un-truncated id
                      checklist and the worked exemplar) or \`minimal\` (the block
                      as it stood before 2026-08-23: same obligations, delivered
                      just as reliably, asking the OLD question). It is stamped
                      into obligations.json, and \`discharge\` degrades to the
                      \`test -s\` floor when it reads \`minimal\` — a gate must
                      never grade a contract the block did not ask for. A value
                      that is neither is a WIRING bug and exits 2.
  --mint <spec>       which D2 minting arms run, as a comma-list over
                      \`all-in-diff\` (contract obligations for symbols whose
                      every reference is inside the diff) and \`registrations\`
                      (security obligations for route/hook registration order).
                      Absent = neither — the baseline document, byte-identical.
                      Stamped into obligations.json as \`minting\`. Any unknown
                      token is a WIRING bug and exits 2 before the document is
                      read — a typo'd arm silently running baseline would
                      report a number for an experiment that never happened.
  --family-caps <spec>  override the per-family ceilings, as a comma-list of
                      \`<family>=<n>\` (or \`=none\` for uncapped), e.g.
                      \`contract=25,security=none\`. A MEASUREMENT seam, not an
                      operator knob: there is no config key for it, and the
                      ceilings' own rationale says the table is untuned and
                      expects to move — so "what is in the tail this ceiling
                      refused, and would any of it have reached gold?" needs to
                      be askable without editing a constant. Families not named
                      keep their shipped ceiling. An unknown family, a negative
                      or a non-numeric value exits 2, unclamped and undefaulted.

Options:
  --repo <dir>        the checkout to analyse            (default: cwd)
  --base <ref>        base ref                           (required)
  --head <ref>        head ref                           (default: HEAD)
  --out <file>        write JSON here                    (default: stdout)
  --tsconfig <file>   force ONE tsconfig for the whole diff. It also disables
                      the orphan fallback — a caller that named a program did
                      not ask for a second to be opened around it.
  --max-files <n>     ceiling on how many files a repository-wide SCAN reads:
                      set B's literal sweep and the tier-2 name index. NOT a
                      compiler budget — the tsgo snapshot holds every tsconfig
                      the diff touches and has none. Hitting it is always named
                      in degraded[], because an absence claim over a truncated
                      file set is unsound rather than merely weak.
  --max-references <n>  cap reference sites recorded per symbol (0 = unbounded)
  --sides <spec>      constants side partition, e.g. client=web/,server=api/
  --rules <file>      opengrep ruleset (default: the local one in rules/)
  --report <file>     coverage artifact instead of the usual candidates
  --stage             npm pack changed runtime deps into .lastlight/ (NETWORK)
  --stage-diff        ALSO write the diff to disk once — an index plus one
                      unified patch per changed file, under
                      .lastlight/pr-review/diff/. No network. The f1 lever: five
                      survey branches re-derived ONE fixed merge-base range ~30
                      times across ~93 bash calls per case, and every
                      re-derivation is a fresh chance to spell it two-dot.
                      Failing to stage is DEGRADED at most — never a failed run
  --stage-diff-dir <d>  where those patches go (default .lastlight/pr-review/diff)
  --never-fail        the phase wrapper: on failure write a coverage:"none"
                      envelope and exit 0 (see §D12 — a failed run is
                      re-dispatched every 30 minutes, forever)
  --version           print versions and exit

Exit codes:
  0  analysis ran and the result is trustworthy
  2  analysis could not run — NOTHING downstream may read this as "no findings"
  3  analysis ran degraded — results PLUS a populated degraded[]
