/**
 * Render one family's obligations as the block a survey phase reads.
 *
 * **Emitted from code, not from a prompt template.** This is WP0's most
 * expensive lesson, reused verbatim: `renderSpecObligations` emits its own fence
 * and its own discharge contract for the same reason, because *the instruction
 * and the mechanism it governs must not be separable*. A fork that kept the
 * obligations and dropped the "quote a line or say it is absent" rule would
 * reproduce exactly what candidate v3 measured — a 17-row ledger, honestly
 * discharged, **zero findings** — and the arm would read as "facts-seeding does
 * not work" when what failed was the discharge contract.
 *
 * The prompt template points at this block. The block carries the rule.
 *
 * ── The rule had no field to be written in, for two whole runs ──────────────
 *
 * Measured 2026-08-23 across both preserved runs, all eight cases, every family:
 * **not one obligation carried a discharge code — 0/31, 0/34, 0/40, every
 * time.** The block demanded *"exactly one of QUOTE / ABSENT / PARTIAL /
 * PROBE"* and the prescribed row shape it printed twenty lines later had **no
 * field to put one in**. That is not model non-compliance; it is a contract that
 * was never expressible in the format the same block demanded. The third
 * instance of this package's recurring shape — after the conservation gate that
 * passed falsely and the model-minted ids that collided — and the header above
 * had already written the principle down: *the instruction and the mechanism it
 * governs must not be separable*. The mechanism half was missing.
 *
 * So the row now carries `discharge`, in the spelling `checkDischarge` reads
 * (`discharge.ts`), beside the obligation id; the block lists **every id that
 * needs one**, wrapped and never truncated, exactly as the discharge ledger
 * does; and `tests/seed-render.test.ts` feeds the rendered exemplar back through
 * `checkDischarge` so the emitted shape cannot drift out of the gate's reading.
 *
 * ── …and then recall went to zero. `--contract minimal` is the control ──────
 *
 * Measured the same day on `prreview__skillspro-1587-r2` with `--repeats 3`:
 * discharge compliance 0/33 → **33/33**, and the union of matched gold **4-of-5
 * → 0-of-5**, three repeats running. Half to two thirds of every hypothesis
 * became a *clean quote* — `discharge: QUOTE`, `failureScenario: null`, "I found
 * the line and it is fine" — 23, 25 and 30 clean of 45, 48 and 46.
 *
 * Two causes and the run cannot separate them, because two things changed at
 * once: the obligations may ask the WRONG QUESTION and making a wrong question
 * mandatory turns hunting into checklist-clearing (C1); or reliable seeding
 * itself suppresses discovery (C2 — the same commit stopped ~24% of survey
 * branches losing their seed entirely).
 *
 * So BOTH blocks live in this file, selected by `ObligationsDocument.contract`.
 * `full` is what is above and is the default, byte-for-byte. `minimal` is this
 * file exactly as it stood at `5fa06da1^` — restored from the diff, not
 * reimagined — which holds the delivery fix constant and puts the question back.
 * Two exceptions, each deliberate and each named at its site: the never-empty
 * rule below is DELIVERY and is kept under both, and the obligation line goes
 * back to `discharge:` under `minimal` (see {@link renderOne}).

 * The f1 lever's half of the brief: **the diff is already on disk; do not
 * re-derive the range.**
 *
 * Measured, and it is two costs in one. Across the five survey branches a case
 * spends ~93 bash calls, ~30 of which re-derive ONE fixed merge-base range that
 * `facts.json` already holds — and surveys are ~75% of a case's spend. That is
 * the money. The other cost is correctness: every re-derivation is a fresh
 * chance to write `git diff base..HEAD` instead of `base...HEAD`, and two-dot
 * reports every commit the base branch picked up since the fork as though the
 * author wrote it (50 real PRs, 9 diverge, one 6,125 files against 3).
 *
 * ── It is an AFFORDANCE, and the framing is measured ─────────────────────────
 *
 * The first cut said *"read the staged patch INSTEAD OF running `git diff`"* and
 * over-suppressed: total survey bash calls fell 848 → 399, but the eliminated
 * range re-derivation accounts for only ~276 of that — ~170 non-derivation calls
 * (greps, file reads, reference tracing) went with it, and internal recall fell
 * 21/25 → 12/25. Access was never reduced: the staged diff sits INSIDE the full
 * checkout. A prohibition plus patch-anchoring narrowed the *behaviour*.
 *
 * So exactly one thing is forbidden — re-deriving the range — and the section
 * says out loud that the patch is a starting point rather than a scope. That
 * half is not decoration; it is the half the measurement says was missing.
 *
 * ── It is NEVER silently omitted ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Three states and three different paragraphs, because they are three different
 * facts and locked decision 6 is that they must never collapse:
 *
 *   - staged        — here is the index, here are your family's files, read them
 *   - staging FAILED — `files: null`; the affordance is missing and you must
 *                      derive the range yourself, three-dot
 *   - never staged   — no record in the envelope at all; same instruction, and
 *                      it says so rather than leaving the section out
 *
 * A missing section would read to a survey as *"this deployment has no staged
 * diff"*, which is precisely the *"we could not look"* / *"we looked and it is
 * clean"* conflation the rest of this pipeline is built to prevent.
 *
 * ── Every path here is CHECKOUT-RELATIVE, and that is measured too ───────────
 *
 * Across three stored runs, 98 of 98 relative first-turn reads from a survey
 * branch succeeded and 0 of 27 workspace-root-absolute ones did: the only
 * absolute path a branch has been handed by its first turn is its skill bundle,
 * which lives one directory ABOVE the checkout the deterministic phases write
 * in. So this section never prints an absolute path and says out loud not to
 * build one.

 *
 * With a block always on disk, a missing file is unambiguous: something between
 * the seeder and the reader broke. `pr-review.yaml`'s `seed` phase prints a
 * per-family manifest off the same fact, and the survey branch is handed a loud

 * Which block is rendered comes off `doc.contract` rather than an argument: the

 * the three cannot disagree. A document written before the field existed reads
 * as `full`.
 *
 * `staged` is the ONE thing that does come as an argument, because it is not the
 * seeder's to stamp: it belongs to the `facts` envelope (`stagedDiff`), which
 * the seeder reads and does not own. The caller (`cli.ts`'s `seed`) passes it

 *
 * It used to look for the substring `"budget"` in a `dropped[]` reason. The
 * 2026-08-25 move from a pooled budget to per-family ceilings reworded every
 * reason to `"per-family ceiling"` / `"total backstop"`, so from that commit to
 * this one **the notice never rendered at all** — measured on the eight gate
 * cases, `1587-r3` dropped 59 obligations across four families and every one of
 * its briefs claimed, by omission, to be the complete set. That is exactly the
 * *"we could not look" vs "we looked and it is clean"* conflation this package
 * exists to prevent, arriving through a stale string match.
 *
 * So it reads the STRUCTURED row now (`minted` − `obligations`), not prose. A
 * document written before those fields existed falls back to the `dropped[]`
 * scan, keyed on the reason the seeder actually emits.
 *
 * Two distinct claims, deliberately two paragraphs:
 *
 * - **The family's own ceiling** — this family had more to say. Nothing was
 *   taken by another family, which is the whole property the ceilings bought.
 * - **The total backstop** — the lowest-ranked across every family, applied
 *   after the ceilings. On a shipped configuration it cannot bind, so if a
 *   survey ever reads this line an operator has raised a ceiling.
