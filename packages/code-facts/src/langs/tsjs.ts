/**
 * The TypeScript / TSX / JavaScript descriptors.
 *
 * **This exists so the tier-2 path runs through the SAME code a second language
 * would.** TS/JS is the only tier where a type-resolved reference set is also
 * available (the tsgo checker, tier 1), which makes it the only place a name-matched
 * reference set can be *measured* rather than argued about: build both over the
 * same symbols and diff them. `scripts/name-match-gate.ts` is that measurement,
 * and it is the reason this file was written before any new grammar was added —
 * a name-matching engine that turns out to be too noisy to ship costs 0 MB to
 * discover here and 36.5 MB to discover after four grammars are vendored.
 *
 * `@ast-grep/napi` already bundles the ts / tsx / js / jsx grammars, so nothing
 * here adds a dependency.
 *
 * Three descriptors rather than one, because they are three grammars:
 *
 *   - `typescript`  `.ts` `.mts` `.cts`
 *   - `tsx`         `.tsx` `.jsx`   — `.jsx` is parsed by the TSX grammar, which
 *                                     is what `astGrepLangFor` has always done:
 *                                     the JavaScript grammar does not accept JSX
 *   - `javascript`  `.js` `.mjs` `.cjs` `.es6`
 *
 * The three share one rule table (`RULES` below) because tree-sitter-typescript
 * is tree-sitter-javascript plus type syntax: every JS node kind is a TS node
 * kind, and a TS-only kind (`interface_declaration`) simply never matches in a
 * `.js` file. Duplicating the table per grammar is how `.es6` came to be missing
 * from one of the two extension tables this package used to carry.
