/**
 * The registry: a literal array, resolved at build time.
 *
 * **Not a plugin system, on purpose.** A registration API would be a public
 * surface with no second implementor, and a dynamically-discovered language is
 * a language that can silently fail to load — which is the one failure mode
 * this package is engineered against (see CLAUDE.md, "the two loudness
 * surfaces"). Adding a language is an import and an array entry, in a diff a
 * reviewer can read.
 *
 * The TS/JS entries are the grammars `@ast-grep/napi` bundles. Python, Go and
 * Java are DYNAMIC grammars (`@ast-grep/lang-*`, loaded through
 * `registerDynamicLanguage` — see `dynamic.ts`): listing them here costs
 * nothing, because nothing is loaded until the first parse that needs one, and
 * a grammar that fails to load is reported per language rather than taking the
 * run down. They are tier 2 only — name matching, never type-aware.
