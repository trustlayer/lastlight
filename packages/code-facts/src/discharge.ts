/**
 * `discharge` — the SURVEY loop's exit gate, and the third "an instruction is
 * not a mechanism" in this package.
 *
 * WP3 (`docs/plans/deterministic-pr-levers.md` §WP3). It answers
 * one question: **did every obligation this family owns get a recorded
 * discharge — QUOTE, ABSENT, PARTIAL or PROBE — in
 * `hypotheses/<family>.jsonl`?**
 *
 * ── What it replaces, and why one line was never enough ─────────────────────
 *
 * Each of the six survey branches in `pr-review.yaml` was gated by
 *
 *     until_bash: test -s .lastlight/pr-review/hypotheses/<family>.jsonl
 *
 * — which **one line of any content passes**. Meanwhile `seed-render.ts` emits a
 * DISCHARGE contract demanding exactly one of QUOTE / ABSENT / PARTIAL / PROBE
 * per obligation, and nothing checked it. Measured on
 * `prreview__skillspro-1587-r1` (2026-08-22), against 31 obligations:
 *
 *   - `state.jsonl` was ONE line — `{"claim": "no state hypothesis",
 *     "obligationIds": ["O-018", …]}` — for TEN obligations. It listed the ids
 *     and discharged none of them, and the gate passed.
 *   - `security.jsonl` was one free-form line that cited no obligation at all,
 *     against three.
 *   - `enforcement.jsonl` carried nine rows against thirteen obligations.
 *
 * Identical obligation sets then produced 18 hypotheses on one run and 43 on the
 * next (2.4×), and only 1 of 25 gold findings was found by all three runs. The
 * floor was one line; it should be N discharges. This is the same shape as the
 * conservation gate that passed falsely and the model-minted hypothesis ids that
 * collided — an instruction the prompt carried and no machine enforced.
 *
 * ── It reads through `hypotheses.ts`, and that is load-bearing ──────────────
 *
 * Exactly as `findings` and `probes` do. One reader of `hypotheses/*.jsonl`
 * means this gate, the conservation gate and the probe gate can never disagree
 * about which rows exist, how many lines were malformed, or which family a row
 * belongs to (the FILENAME's, never the row's self-report).
 *
 * ── `null` ≠ `[]`, three ways ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The founding distinction of this package, and this gate is where it is most
 * expensive to collapse:
 *
 *   - **No `hypotheses/<family>.jsonl` at all** — nobody looked. `fileState:
 *     "missing"`, and the CLI exits `2` (could not run): there is no document to
 *     grade.
 *   - **An empty one** — looked, recorded nothing. `fileState: "empty"`, exit
 *     `3` when obligations are outstanding: a survey that ran and discharged
 *     nothing is a degraded result, not an absent one.
 *   - **A family marked NOT MEASURED in `obligations.json`** — the seeding
 *     surface was absent, so there was never anything to discharge. It PASSES,
 *     and the note says why, because failing a family for the absence of the
 *     thing it audits is how a gate takes a run down.
 *
 * A family with **zero obligations** passes too. Nothing mechanical was asked
 * of it; the survey still worked the diff, and this gate is in no position to
 * grade that.
 *
 * ── The one degradation, and why it is not a loophole ───────────────────────
 *
 * `pr-review.yaml` runs `seed … || true`, so `obligations.json` can be **absent**
 * — a `coverage: "none"` facts envelope makes `seed` exit before writing one. A
 * gate that demanded a file nothing guarantees would be **unsatisfiable by the
 * agent**, which is precisely WP3's original `$LL_FAMILY` bug (a gate testing
 * `hypotheses/.jsonl`, failing forever, burning every iteration). So with no
 * readable obligations document this command degrades to the `test -s` floor it
 * replaces — one parsed row passes — and says in its output that it graded
 * NOTHING. An **unknown family** is the opposite case and stays fatal: nothing
 * the agent writes can fix a misspelled `--family`, so it must break loudly at
 * the wiring rather than quietly pass.
 *
 * ── The second degradation: `contract: "minimal"` ───────────────────────────
 *
 * Same rule, second instance: **never grade a contract the block did not ask
 * for.** `lastlight-facts seed --contract minimal` renders the obligation block
 * as it stood before 2026-08-23 — no `discharge` field on the prescribed row,
 * no id checklist, no exemplar — as the control for that day's result (recall
 * 4-of-5 → 0-of-5 with compliance 0/33 → 33/33, two variables at once). Measured
 * compliance under exactly that block was 0/31, 0/34 and 0/40. Grading it would
 * fail every family of every run over a field nobody was told to write, which is
 * the `$LL_FAMILY` bug rebuilt out of a config key. So an explicit `minimal` in
 * `obligations.json` falls back to the same `test -s` floor, says so, and
 * suppresses the per-obligation todo list that would otherwise read as the
 * failure the note is denying.
 *
 * ── What it deliberately does NOT do ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It does not read a quote, resolve a `path:line`, judge a claim, or check that
 * an ABSENT really is absent. Candidate v3's five-line existence gate earned the
 * investigation's only gold match and v2's full validator is what made it
 * expensive. This checks that the work was *recorded*, per obligation.
