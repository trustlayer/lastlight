/**
 * `clusterSites` — group hypothesis rows into SITES by where they point, and
 * rank the sites by how many rows point there.
 *
 * The unit survey writes 39–234 rows per case (1,794 over 16 case-arms, 14
 * gold-matched), and every row-level cut tried after it failed: `top:40`
 * (the since-removed `dossier --admit`) filed 7 of the 14 gold, and one `adjudicate` call
 * over the whole set does not finish. Several units and several families
 * routinely flag the same few lines, and that agreement is the signal: in the
 * 2026-09-27 screen (`apps/evals/scripts/cluster-screen.ts`), ±20 lines across
 * families put 10 of the 14 gold in their case's top-5 sites, where 5 sites at
 * random find about 2. See `docs/plans/pr-review-units-sites.md`.
 *
 * A site is a run of rows in one file whose anchor lines sit within `window`
 * lines of their neighbour (single linkage). The anchor is the row's first
 * quote with a path and a line, else `bothEnds.introducedAt` — never claim
 * text, so no rule here reads prose. A row with no anchor is a site of its own.
 *
 * Two measured choices, both defaults for a reason:
 *
 * - **Across families.** Keyed on (family, path), the screen found half as
 *   many gold in the top sites: cross-family agreement IS the vote.
 *   `byFamily` exists as the ablation, not as an option to ship.
 * - **Support before severity.** Severity is nearly flat on unit-survey rows
 *   (91–119 `Important` per 1587/1667 case), so ranking on it first buries
 *   agreed sites under lone Criticals.
 *
 * The known cost is the one every voting scheme pays: a real defect that only
 * one row found ranks low (both gold outside the screen's top 20 are lone
 * rows). A low rank must therefore mean "not weighed first", never "deleted".
 *
 * Three options came out of the first paid site pilot, all off by default so
 * the screen's numbers above still describe the default plan:
 *
 * - **`voters: "unit"`.** Votes echo: one unit wrote 12 rows into one site, and
 *   a unit split by family re-reads the same lines up to six times. Ranking on
 *   distinct voters (a row's `unitId`, split siblings collapsed to `splitOf`)
 *   put 8.7 of 14 gold in the top 5 against 9 for rows — about as good, and
 *   not inflatable by one chatty unit. `Site.voters` is always reported.
 * - **`maxSpan`.** Single linkage chains: the pilot's `site-001` ran from line
 *   1 to 125 of one file on 38 rows, too wide for one investigator to hold.
 *   A run whose span would pass `maxSpan` starts a new site instead.
 * - **`skipPath`** (e.g. `isTestPath` from `project.ts`, the per-language
 *   test-file heuristic `facts` already uses). 3 of the pilot's top 10 sites
 *   were `*.test.ts` files, crowding out the code under review. Skipped
 *   rows form no site; their ids go to `SitePlan.skipped`, so every row is
 *   still accounted for exactly once.
 *
 * Sites decide WHERE to look; {@link siteLeads} and {@link renderSiteBrief}
 * hand a per-site investigator what the rows said there, from the typed
 * `evidence.subject` only.
