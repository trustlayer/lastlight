/**
 * `constants` — references MINUS literals.
 *
 * **The subtraction is the insight.** For each changed constant:
 *
 *   A = every reference to the IDENTIFIER            (the tsgo checker)
 *   B = every occurrence of the literal VALUE        (ast-grep)
 *   report A, and report `B \ A` as HARD-CODED DUPLICATES — sites that use the
 *   value without going through the constant.
 *
 * A constant with references only on one side of a boundary — defined in
 * config, read by the client, never compared server-side — is exactly the
 * `1587-r2` Critical, the single gold finding the investigation ever converted.
 * `sides` is a heuristic path-prefix partition: A HINT FOR THE SEEDER, never a
 * finding on its own — and it is `null`, never all-zeros, whenever `references`
 * is `null`, because a partition of a set that was never computed is an absence
 * claim built from no data.
 *
 * ast-grep rather than a text scan is not fussiness — it is what keeps `900` in
 * a comment, or inside an unrelated string, out of set B. A literal search that
 * matches prose produces obligations about nothing, and an obligation about
 * nothing gets honestly discharged (00-evidence §3, v3 iteration 2).

 *    entry is a `path:line` citation and the envelope stamps `headSha`; reading

 *  - The ceiling starts meaning something, because it is charged after the

 * the alternative (one ast-grep pass per constant) is quadratic and was the
 * obvious way to blow the phase's wall-clock budget. Contents are visited one
 * file at a time and dropped, so the scan holds the hits and nothing else.
 *
 * It returns the TRUNCATION FLAG and the LISTING SOURCE alongside the hits, and
 * `extractConstants` turns both into `degraded[]` entries. Without the first
 * this extractor reports an absence claim — "no other site hard-codes this
 * value" — over an arbitrary prefix of the repository; without the second, a
 * walk-tier result is indistinguishable from a tree-tier one.
