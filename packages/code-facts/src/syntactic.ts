/**
 * The syntactic engine — ONE PASS, three maps, no types.
 *
 * ```
 * declarations : name  → every site in the repo that BINDS that name
 * references   : name  → every site in the repo that MENTIONS it
 * literals     : value → every site that spells that value out
 * ```
 *
 * **Everything here is a name match, and the whole file is written around
 * saying so.** `run` in one file and `run` in another are the same string; a
 * parser without a type-checker cannot tell you they are the same symbol, and
 * nothing in this module pretends otherwise. Every `SymbolFact` it produces
 * carries `resolution: "name-match"` beside `nameAmbiguity` — how many distinct
 * declaration sites in the repo bind that same name — so the layer above can
 * RANK on the ambiguity instead of inheriting the guess.
 *
 * `nameAmbiguity` is data, never a filter. This layer generates hypotheses; a
 * filter here would silently delete the evidence the seeder is supposed to
 * weigh, and the corpus measurement that motivated the whole exercise
 * ("coverage x2.00 while the candidate pool went x2.09") is precisely a warning
 * about a pool that grows without the hits growing with it. The counter to that
 * is a rankable pool, not a smaller one.
 *
 * ## Why one pass
 *
 * `constants` already walks the whole repository to build set B (every
 * occurrence of a literal value). Folding the declaration and reference indexes
 * into that same walk makes them close to free: the same `git ls-tree` listing,
 * the same `git cat-file --batch` blob reads, the same parse. The alternative —
 * a second enumeration — would have doubled the one part of this package that
 * has ever dominated its wall clock.
 *
 * The file set comes from `git.listFiles`, so `.gitignore` is honoured by
 * construction and the scan resolves against a COMMIT rather than the working
 * directory (CLAUDE.md, "THE FILE SET COMES FROM GIT"). Every `path:line` this
 * module emits is therefore a claim about `headSha`.
