/**
 * `seed` — turn an `all` envelope into **mechanism-complete obligations**.
 *
 * A pure transform over a document this package already emits. No repo access,
 * no compiler, no network: hand it `facts.json`, get `obligations.json`. That is
 * what makes it testable against real envelopes rather than through a harness,
 * and it is why the seeder lives here rather than in `apps/server`.
 *
 * ## The one rule that governs the format
 *
 * > **A seed naming one end of a defect mechanism is worse than no seed.**
 *
 * IRIS's ablation: CodeQL sources + LLM sinks = +9; **LLM sources + CodeQL
 * sinks = −3, actively worse than seeding nothing**; both ends = +28, roughly
 * 2× recall. So `introducedAt` and `enforcedAt` are both REQUIRED, a one-ended
 * obligation fails validation, and every drop is counted with a reason in the
 * document. Never silently — a truncated list that looks complete is the
 * dependency-cruiser failure mode locked decision 6 exists to prevent.
 *
 * `enforcedAt.found: false` with a `candidates` list is a *valid* second end.
 * "We looked here and found nothing" is a mechanism, and it is the one that
 * converted. What is invalid is omitting the field.
 *
 * ## And the rule that governs the QUESTION
 *
 * v3's lesson 1: seeding works at **question granularity**. *"Check this area"*
 * earns an honest CLEAN, because an obligation one abstraction level too high is
 * discharged AT THAT LEVEL and the defect lives below it. *"Quote the line that
 * enforces THIS constant"* produced the only gold match the investigation has.
 * So every `question` is answerable by quoting one line, or by stating that no
 * such line exists.
 *
 * ## What the families are built FROM, and why not from what you would guess
 *
 * Measured 2026-08-22 on the eight `skillspro` cases the gates are read on
 * (the retired WP3 doc §"Measured 2026-08-22", in git history; see
 * `docs/plans/deterministic-pr-levers.md` §"Seed and survey (WP3)"):
 *
 * - **`enforcement` is built from the SUBTRACTION, never from `sides`.** `sides`
 *   is a heuristic path partition and it is **inert** on the gate repo — all 14
 *   constants of `1587-r2` partition to `shared`, with `client: 0, server: 0`,
 *   because nobody configured `--sides` for it. The `1587-r2` mechanism *is*
 *   "referenced client-side, never compared server-side", so the one field that
 *   would have expressed it is the one that is empty. `references` and
 *   `hardCodedDuplicates` are populated, and their relationship is the
 *   mechanism: a value referenced twice and hard-coded sixteen times elsewhere
 *   is a boundary nobody is enforcing.
 * - **`security` does not treat scanners as a discovery axis.** With both
 *   binaries installed the corpus produced 13 real `patterns` findings and
 *   **+0 EC-loose** — not one pointed at a place any gold finding was about. So
 *   the sink half comes from the impact cone and a scanner hit is *corroboration
 *   on an obligation that already exists*, never the reason one exists.
 * - **`tests` is inert until [WP4]'s `prepare`.** `coverage` READS a report and
 *   nothing produces one: 0 artifacts across 50 corpus cases and 8 gate cases.
 *   It is reported `notMeasured`, never "did not convert".
 * - **`spec` is not produced here at all.** It is seeded from the PR body and
 *   the linked issue, which this package cannot see; it is WP0's
 *   `review-spec.ts`, harness-side, and already shipped.
 *
 * ## The coverage set is SEALED
 *
 * Taken from `alibaba/open-code-review`. Every obligation is registered before
 * any model call and the denominator is then frozen, so a run cannot grow its
 * denominator to match what it achieved — which is the only way it can lie. The
 * terminal state is derived from coverage alone, never from a finding count:
 * `selected == 0` is **skipped**, not success, and anything short of full is
 * **partial**. That is the state §D12 lacked — loud in the artifact about work
 * never done, without failing the run and re-arming the 30-minute re-dispatch
 * loop.

 * `over the per-PR budget … These are NOT "checked"` — so a family's questions
 * went unasked because a *different* family had a lot to say, which is not what
 * a ranking is supposed to mean. Two of `1667`'s five gold findings are
 * security-family.
 *
 * Reserving slots inside the pool (the floors this replaces) was the wrong
 * shape for two reasons, and both are about what the number BUYS:
 *
 * 1. **Cross-family ranking prices incommensurable things against each other.**
 *    A `contract` rank of 91 and a `security` rank of 41 are not two points on
 *    one scale — the weights are a mechanism CLASS ordering, not a probability,
 *    and subtracting one family's questions from another's on the strength of
 *    them is arithmetic nobody has evidence for.
 * 2. **The cost is PER BRANCH, not per document.** Each family's obligations
 *    feed exactly one survey branch, so a pooled cap bounds the sum while the
 *    thing that actually costs money and context is the fattest single branch.
 *    A ceiling bounds that directly; a pool never did.
 *
 * So each family keeps its own top obligations in the existing global-rank
 * order, truncated at its own ceiling, and no family's excess can displace
 * another's — which is what the floors were reaching for and did not reach.
 * Replayed over the eight gate cases' stored `facts.json` (2026-08-25, $0, the
 * `wp3-run3` artifacts): under the pooled budget plus floors, `contract` got
 * **17, 15 and 8** slots on the three near-identical `1587` envelopes — the
 * SAME family, on the same PR, swinging by a factor of two on where the other
 * families' ranks happened to fall — while `enforcement` took 16 and `state`
 * 13 of `1587-r3`'s forty. Under ceilings all three cases read 12/12/3/8.
 * A budget whose per-family split moves like that is a budget no result can be
 * attributed to, which is the other half of why this changed.
 *
 * The numbers are the two converting classes at 12 (`contract`, `enforcement`)
 * and the rest at 8, summing to {@link DEFAULT_MAX_OBLIGATIONS}. Nothing here
 * is tuned — when a family's ceiling is measured to bind on something that
 * converts, this is the table that moves.
 *
 * The sixth family, `spec`, is not here: it is seeded harness-side by WP0's
 * `review-spec.ts` under its own `review.analysis.maxSpecObligations` bound.
 * Same shape, different owner — a per-family ceiling on a per-branch cost —
 * and it is deliberately not folded into this table, because this package
 * cannot see the PR body or the linked issue it is built from.
