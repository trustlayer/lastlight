/**
 * The unit survey's REQUEST text — the complete user message one model call
 * receives for one unit, rendered deterministically from what `units.ts`
 * assembled.
 *
 * It replaces a five-branch agent survey, so it carries every family's
 * question at once, compactly: an agent branch spent minutes re-deriving with
 * bash the context `facts`/`seed` had already computed, and here that context
 * is simply printed. What the prompts' long prose was FOR survives as one line
 * per family — the question, and what "closes" the mechanism for it, because
 * `control_site` is the one field of the evidence record whose meaning each
 * family fixes.
 *
 * ── The line tags are the contract, not decoration ─────────────────────────
 *
 * Every shown source line is `L<number>` + a change marker + `|`, under a
 * `FILE <path>` header. The reply's `line` must be one of those tags, and
 * {@link requestLineTags} reads them back out of the request text, so the
 * ingest checks the reply against exactly what the model was shown rather
 * than against a second copy of the rendering rules. Removed lines are shown
 * (`-|`) but carry no tag: they do not exist at head, so nothing can be
 * anchored to them.
 *
 * Nothing time- or run-dependent is printed — no sha, no timestamp — so an
 * unchanged unit renders byte-identically across re-pushes and its
 * `requestSha256` is a usable cache key.
 *
 * ── Shared prefix first, then the unit ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A request is {@link UNITS_SHARED_PREFIX} (task, line-tag legend, the
 * always-asked families, the evidence record, the generic response rules —
 * unit-independent, byte-identical for every unit) followed by the
 * unit-specific part after {@link UNIT_SEPARATOR}. Providers cache the longest
 * shared prompt prefix, so anything that varies by unit — its id, its counts, a
 * conditional family such as `tests` — belongs after the separator.
