/**
 * `findings` — the `adjudicate` loop's exit gate, and the conservation check.
 *
 * WP6c (`docs/plans/deterministic-pr-levers.md` §"Adjudication and the
 * attention boundary (WP6)").
 * It answers one question: **did every hypothesis the surveys produced reach
 * `findings.json` with exactly one recorded disposition, and is every deletion
 * backed by a probe transcript that exists?**
 *
 * ── Why existence-plus-schema was not enough ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * §D11 is blunt about it: *"An adjudicator reading 30 hypotheses and writing 6
 * findings would have passed every gate in this plan — which is exactly v2,
 * which worked mechanically and cost recall anyway."* v2's ruthless judge moved
 * micro-recall 1/25 → 2/25 while the precision canary regressed and cost went
 * 2.4×; BitsAI-CR's ReviewFilter reproduced the same trade independently
 * (precision 54.5 → 67.1, recall 45.5 → 39.8). A unit test can check the
 * plumbing. It cannot check a model's compliance. This can, because silent
 * omission stops being possible by construction rather than by instruction.
 *
 * ── The asymmetry, mechanised ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The adjudicator *"may re-rank, re-tier, and demote a finding into the review
 * body. It may delete a finding only when a probe transcript refutes it."*
 * Demotion is not suppression — `post-review` still renders a `body`-tier
 * finding under *"Additional findings"*, so it is posted and visible. Deletion
 * is the one move that costs recall outright, so it is the one move that has to
 * show its working: a `dropped` entry names `refutedBy`, and that file has to be
 * on disk. A refutation by argument is exactly the intervention this whole
 * pipeline is a reaction to.
 *
 * ── `--repair`: the §D12 FLOOR, and what makes this a mechanism ─────────────
 *
 * A gate that can only fail is a gate that eventually takes a run down —
 * `cron-review.yaml` re-dispatches every thirty minutes and a phase that never
 * closes burns the budget forever. So the last iteration runs with `--repair`:
 * every uncovered hypothesis is APPENDED at `tier: "internal"` (recorded, never
 * posted), and every unbacked deletion is **un-deleted** — removed from
 * `dropped` and promoted back to an internal finding. An unjustified deletion
 * becomes a recorded non-deletion. That is the asymmetry of this work package
 * expressed as code, and it is why the floor can never be reached by simply
 * dropping everything.
 *
 * ── What it deliberately does NOT do ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It reads no transcript, judges no verdict, and validates no quote. Candidate
 * v3's gate was an existence check and earned the investigation's only gold
 * match; v2's full quote validator was overkill and is what made it expensive.
 * Quote *resolution* stays checked upstream; quote *semantics* stays unchecked.
