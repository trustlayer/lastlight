/**
 * The re-review delta — which units of this head the LAST review already had,
 * byte for byte (issue #429).
 *
 * A re-review used to start from scratch: every unit surveyed, every site
 * re-ranked, so each round's five investigator slots landed on a different
 * slice of code that had not changed since round one, and found something
 * new there. Measured over nearform PRs: 46% of later-round comments sat on
 * unchanged code.
 *
 * The grain is the UNIT, not the line. A unit already has a stable identity
 * across heads — the file and the symbol it covers — so resyncing after a
 * push needs no line-translation engine and survives a force-push (where the
 * prior head is not an ancestor and no line diff between them exists):
 *
 * - `key` — `path::symbol` (`path::(module)` for a file's loose changed lines,
 *   `(pr)` for the PR-level unit), with `#n` only where two distinct units of
 *   one file would collide. A unit split into passes or by family shares its
 *   parent's key: it is one piece of code, surveyed in several requests.
 * - `contentSha` — sha256 of the unit's OWN lines (its cores, trailing
 *   whitespace dropped), never their line numbers, so an edit above a function
 *   does not make the function new. `null` for the `pr` unit, whose content
 *   is a set of obligations with run-minted ids: it is always in scope.
 *
 * Against the prior review's units (`prior-review.json`, written by the
 * workflow from core's ledger), each unit is:
 *
 * - `new` — its key was not in the last review;
 * - `changed` — same key, different content (or no content hash);
 * - `affected` — unchanged itself, but a caller or callee of it sits inside a
 *   new or changed unit, so a fix may have changed what it does;
 * - `unchanged` — the last review had exactly this code, and nothing it calls
 *   or is called by changed. Its hypothesis rows form no site.
 *
 * The unit delta decides only WHERE a re-review looks. Whether a finding is
 * a late discovery is decided per LINE ({@link anchorDelta}): each review
 * records the hashes of the lines its units covered, and a finding whose
 * anchored lines were all already there is on code the last review had.
 *
 * No `prior-review.json` (a first review) ⇒ no unit carries a `delta`, and
 * nothing downstream scopes or gates anything.
