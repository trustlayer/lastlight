/**
 * The rendered survey block, and the loop this file's bug opened.
 *
 * `seed-render.ts` emitted a DISCHARGE contract — *"exactly one of QUOTE /
 * ABSENT / PARTIAL / PROBE"* — and, twenty lines further down the same block,
 * a prescribed row shape with **no field to write one in**. Measured 2026-08-23
 * across both preserved runs, all eight cases, every family: **0/31, 0/34,
 * 0/40 obligations carried a code.** Not non-compliance — a contract that was
 * never expressible in the format the block demanded.
 *
 * So the assertions here are not "does the prose say the right words". The load
 * bearing one is the **round trip**: take the row the block prescribes, write it
 * where the block says to write it, and hand it to the gate that grades it
 * (`checkDischarge`). If the two ever drift apart again — a renamed field, a
 * lowercased code, an exemplar edited into a shape the reader does not
 * recognise — this fails, and it fails in the package that owns both halves.
 *
 * Every assertion with teeth is paired with its **non-vacuity control**: the
 * same fixture with the one field removed, asserted to FAIL. A round trip that
 * would pass either way is not a round trip.
