/**
 * `probes` — the `falsify` loop's exit gate.
 *
 * Two properties carry the whole file, and both are things this codebase has
 * already been burned by:
 *
 * **It must be SATISFIABLE, honestly.** WP3's first design gated six survey
 * passes on `hypotheses/$LL_FAMILY.jsonl` with a variable that was never set, so
 * the gate tested `hypotheses/.jsonl`, always failed, and the loop ran to
 * `max_iterations` against a condition that meant nothing. A gate a pass cannot
 * close is worse than no gate: it burns the budget AND teaches nothing.
 *
 * **It must not accept a refutation by argument.** *"You may add evidence and
 * lower confidence; you may not drop a hypothesis without a counter-transcript"*
 * is the rule with money on it — the intervention that raised precision
 * 54.5 → 67.1 and cut recall 45.5 → 39.8 is exactly a verifier that deletes on
 * reasoning. So a `refuted` verdict naming a transcript that does not exist is a
 * gap, not a pass.
