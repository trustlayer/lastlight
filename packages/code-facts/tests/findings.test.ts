/**
 * `findings` — the `adjudicate` loop's exit gate, and the conservation check.
 *
 * The property under test is the one §D11 says nothing in the plan enforced:
 * **an adjudicator that reads thirty hypotheses and writes six findings must not
 * pass.** That is v2, which *"worked mechanically"* and cost recall anyway, and
 * it passed every existence-plus-schema gate this plan had. So every test here
 * is about a hypothesis id and where it went — not about whether the document
 * parses.
 *
 * Three of them carry money directly:
 *
 * - **A drop with no transcript fails.** *"You may add evidence and lower
 *   confidence; you may not drop a hypothesis without a counter-transcript."*
 *   A refutation by argument is exactly the intervention that raised precision
 *   54.5 → 67.1 and cut recall 45.5 → 39.8.
 * - **A finding with no `hypotheses` field fails nothing.** Those are the
 *   shipped reviewer's own findings; a gate that demanded provenance from them
 *   would delete the reviewer we already have.
 * - **No hypothesis files at all passes.** The gate must never fail a run for
 *   the absence of the thing it audits — the pipeline being off is not a
 *   finding.
