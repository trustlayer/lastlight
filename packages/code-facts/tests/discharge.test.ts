/**
 * `discharge` — the survey's exit gate.
 *
 * The property under test is the one the six `until_bash` lines never had:
 * **a survey that writes one line for ten obligations must not pass.** That is
 * the measured shape, not a hypothetical — `prreview__skillspro-1587-r1` wrote
 *
 *     {"claim": "no state hypothesis", "obligationIds": ["O-018", …]}
 *
 * one line, ten obligations, and `test -s` passed it. So every test here is
 * about an obligation id and whether something answered it — never about
 * whether the file parses.
 *
 * Four of them carry the epistemics directly:
 *
 * - **A missing `hypotheses/<family>.jsonl` is not an empty one.** Nobody
 *   looked, versus looked and recorded nothing. `null` ≠ `[]`, in the gate
 *   where collapsing it is most expensive.
 * - **A NOT MEASURED family is not a failure.** The seeding surface was absent,
 *   so there was never anything to discharge, and failing a family for the
 *   absence of the thing it audits is how a gate takes a run down.
 * - **A zero-obligation family passes.** Nothing mechanical was asked of it.
 * - **`--ledger` always exits 0 and writes nothing.** Its caller is the survey's
 *   own bash tool, where the gate's "iterate again" reads as a tool failure.
 *
 * Fixtures are real files in a real tree, per this package's house rule: every
 * claim here is a claim about what is on disk, and mocking the filesystem would
 * let the claim be wrong while the test passed.
