/**
 * `lastlight-shared` — the light modules shared by the published `lastlight`
 * CLI and `lastlight-core`. Node built-ins + `yaml` / `@clack/prompts` /
 * `chalk` / `@earendil-works/pi-ai` (oauth subpath) / `proper-lockfile` (the
 * oauth store lock) / `lastlight-workflow-engine` (workflow schema) only — no
 * heavy runtime deps (drizzle/libsql, slack,
 * octokit, hono, otel, agentic-pi) are ever reachable from here (fence F4).
 *
 * Invariant: no edge from `shared` back to `lastlight-core`.
 *
 * `./oauth` and `./workflow-loader` are also exposed as dedicated subpaths so
 * core can keep thin re-export shims at their original file paths (preserving
 * `vi.mock` targets + module-singleton identity) without leaking the whole
 * barrel through those paths.
