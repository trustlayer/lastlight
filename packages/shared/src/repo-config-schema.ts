/**
 * The PURE half of the per-repository config layer (issue #180) — the schema,
 * the operator bounds, and the validators/merger that enforce them.
 *
 * A managed repo may commit a `.lastlight/` directory that overrides a BOUNDED
 * subset of Last Light's config for runs against that repo. The directory
 * mirrors a deployment overlay's on-disk shape exactly:
 *
 *   .lastlight/
 *     lastlight.yml                  # the config override
 *     workflows/prompts/*.md         # prompt overrides
 *     skills/<name>/SKILL.md         # skill overrides
 *     agent-context/*.md             # persona/rules additions
 *
 * ── Why this lives in `lastlight-shared` ──────────────────────────────────
 * Two consumers need exactly the same answers about a `.lastlight/` tree:
 *   - `lastlight-core` at runtime, after fetching the layer from GitHub
 *     (`apps/server/src/config/repo-config.ts`, which owns the impure half —
 *     the fetch, the TTL cache, the on-disk unpack — and re-exports everything
 *     here so its import surface is unchanged); and
 *   - the `lastlight` CLI, offline, inside a user's own code repo
 *     (`lastlight repo config validate`).
 * The CLI must never gain a dependency edge to core, so the bounds logic sits
 * here — the one package both already depend on. Nothing in this file touches
 * the filesystem, the network, or runtime config: it is a function of its
 * arguments, which is also what makes it directly unit-testable.
 *
 * ── The trust rule ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The layer is ALWAYS read from the repo's **default branch**. Never a PR head.
 * Never the sandbox checkout. That rule is enforced by the fetcher in core;
 * this module only describes what may appear in the layer once it arrives.
 *
 * ── The failure rule ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Warn, drop the bad bits, run anyway. A repo's config file must never fail a
 * run. Invalid YAML drops the whole file; an unknown or out-of-bounds key drops
 * just that key. Every rejection becomes a structured {@link RepoConfigWarning}
 * so the dashboard/CLI can report it back to the repo's owners.
