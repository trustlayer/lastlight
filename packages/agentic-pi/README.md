# agentic-pi

A pre-configured, opinionated wrapper around [earendil-works/pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi)
that turns it into a **one-shot coding-agent worker** for workflow systems like
[lastlight](https://github.com/nearform/lastlight).

If you already have an orchestrator that wants to spawn an agent for one
phase (architect, build, review, triage, …), pipe a prompt in, and parse a
structured event stream back out, this is what slots in. It does the
boring wiring so you don't have to.

## What this is opinionated about

Pi itself is a deliberately minimal harness — it gives you an SDK, a multi-provider
LLM API, an extension model, and four run modes. agentic-pi makes opinionated
choices on top of all of that for one specific use case:

### 1. One-shot only, no interactive mode

The only command is `agentic-pi run`. It reads the prompt from **stdin**, runs
exactly one agent turn (which may contain many tool calls), emits JSONL to
**stdout**, and exits when Pi's `agent_end` fires. There is no REPL, no chat
loop, no `serve` mode. If a phase needs follow-ups, the orchestrator spawns a
new process.

### 2. JSONL event stream tailored for downstream parsing

Pi natively emits a JSONL event stream in `--mode json`. agentic-pi uses Pi's SDK
in-process, subscribes to the same events, and adds three things on top:

- A leading `{"type":"session", "version":3, "id":<uuid>, "cwd":...}` header.
- `sessionId` and `timestamp` injected onto **every** subsequent event, so a
  downstream consumer can correlate without parsing the header line separately.
- A terminal `{"type":"usage_snapshot", "stats":{...}}` event synthesized from
  `session.getSessionStats()` — because Pi's per-event payloads do **not**
  carry token counts or cost.

If your orchestrator needs cost/token accounting, the snapshot is the
single line you parse.

### 3. GitHub repo operations as first-class native tools

Pi explicitly does not support MCP. agentic-pi ships a native Pi extension
exposing **36 GitHub tools** ported from lastlight's `mcp-github-app`:
clone/publish, issues, PRs, reviews, labels, CI reads, search. Tool names are
prefixed with `github_`.

**Reads are projected, not raw** (`extensions/github/projections.ts`). Octokit
returns the REST payload verbatim, which is written for API clients rather than
for a context window: a dozen `*_url` fields per object, a ~1 kB `user` object
per actor, a complete repository object under a PR's `head` *and* `base`, and
then the genuinely large text — a Renovate changelog body, a lockfile `patch`, a
long review thread. Measured raw against real repos: `listPullRequests` 468 kB,
`listIssues` 254 kB, `listCommits` 142 kB, one Renovate `getPullRequest` 76 kB.
An agent re-sends every one of those on each subsequent step of its loop, so the
cost is the payload times the turns that follow it.

Three rules bound it, applied uniformly so an agent learns one shape:

1. **Project** to the fields prompts branch on — URLs, nested actor/repo objects
   and reaction counts are dropped. List entries carry no body; fetch one with
   `github_get_issue` / `github_get_pull_request`.
2. **Cap prose, and name the lift.** Bodies, review text and commit messages are
   truncated at 4000 chars and a file's `patch` at 2000, with a notice that names
   the flag returning it whole (`full_body`, `full_bodies`, `full_messages`,
   `full_patch`) — so the escape hatch is found at the moment it matters instead
   of costing system-prompt tokens on every run that doesn't need it.
3. **Page, don't cut, the item count.** Every list returns
   `{ items, page, per_page, has_more, next_page }`, so a long comment thread is
   paged rather than silently truncated. Search adds the API's real
   `total_count`.

One default is worth calling out: `github_list_pull_request_files` **omits each
file's `patch`** unless you pass `include_patch`. A lockfile patch alone runs to
tens of thousands of lines, and it was 86% of a measured 7-file payload.

Auth is opinionated: **GitHub App credentials preferred**, static
`GITHUB_TOKEN` only as a low-trust fallback. JWT-minted installation tokens
cached for ~50 minutes, 5-minute refresh buffer. Git operations authenticate
via a github.com-scoped `http.extraheader` (Basic `x-access-token:<token>`)
injected as `GIT_CONFIG_*` env on the git children we spawn — nothing on disk,
and the token can carry any character GitHub returns.

Publishing is opinionated too: `github_publish` replaces `git add`/`git
commit`/`git push` in the `repo-write` profile. A commit built by `git` inside
the sandbox is unsigned, and on a repository with GitHub's
`required_signatures` branch-protection rule, one unsigned commit anywhere in
a branch blocks the pull request permanently — no token fixes that, because
the token authenticates the *push* while a signature is a property of the
*commit object*. `github_publish` diffs the working tree against the branch's
current remote tip (local commits the agent already made are folded in — the
published commit is the working tree as it stands, or the part of it the caller
scopes to; see `include`/`exclude` below) and hands the change set
to GitHub's GraphQL `createCommitOnBranch` mutation, which builds and signs
the commit server-side under the App's bot identity. No signing key is held
anywhere.

Five things worth knowing:

- **The change set is scopeable.** By default it is the whole working tree
  (minus anything `.gitignore`d, since it stages with `git add -A`). `include`
  restricts it to the given pathspecs — everything else stays at its base state
  and so produces no diff at all — and `exclude` subtracts from whatever is
  left, so the two compose. A caller that writes artifacts into the checkout
  alongside the change under review wants `include`; one that writes them into
  an otherwise-publishable tree wants `exclude`.

- **It refuses what it cannot express, atomically, before any remote write.**
  `FileAddition` carries a path and base64 contents, not a file mode, so a
  genuine mode change is rejected up front — a new executable file, a new
  symlink, a submodule pointer, or flipping an existing file's mode either way
  (including `100755` → `100644`, which GitHub would otherwise silently leave
  unchanged rather than actually downgrade). A content-only edit to a file
  that is already `100755` is fine — GitHub preserves the base tree's mode on
  those. This runs before the branch is even created, when publishing to a
  branch that doesn't exist on GitHub yet, and there's no fallback to
  `git push` — that would produce exactly the unsigned commit this tool
  exists to avoid.
- **A tip that moved is refused at both ends, with no retry.** The mutation
  pins `expectedHeadOid`, so a branch that moves between the read and the write
  is rejected (`STALE_DATA`) instead of being clobbered. That covers only half
  of it: a tip that had ALREADY moved before the read passes
  `expectedHeadOid` happily, and the change set is computed as "working tree
  vs. that tip", so every file the other party added would be recorded as a
  deletion. So the tool also checks the tip is in the local checkout's history
  (`git merge-base --is-ancestor`) and refuses before writing anything if it is
  not, naming the recovery for each cause: `git reset --mixed` when the tip is a
  commit an earlier publish landed, and commit-then-merge when somebody else
  pushed (a bare `git merge` aborts on the uncommitted changes this refusal
  always fires with). It never re-diffs
  and retries on its own; a `STALE_DATA` failure names itself in the error and
  re-running the tool call is the fix.
- **There's a size ceiling.** GitHub caps the whole request at 45 MB — the sum
  of every addition in one publish, not a per-file limit. Ordinary publishes
  (source edits, a lockfile) are far under it.
- **It asserts its own signature.** Every publish checks GitHub's response and
  fails loudly if the commit came back unsigned — including the `signature:
  null` GraphQL returns for a commit with no signature at all — or with a
  signature that does not verify. The commit is already on the branch by then,
  so a silent failure here would otherwise only surface later as a blocked PR.

### 4. Permission profiles as a registration-time gate

`--profile <name>` picks one of four allowlists ported from lastlight:

| Profile | Tool count | What it can do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `read` | 21 | Repo/issue/PR/CI reads + search. No mutations. |
| `issues-write` | 28 | Read + issue/comment/label mutations. |
| `review-write` | 30 | Read + issues + PR review/comment + create PR. |
| `repo-write` | 36 | Everything: clone, publish, branch, file edits, merge. |

Tools outside the active profile are **never registered** — the LLM cannot see
them in the system prompt and cannot call them. This is a stronger guarantee
than a runtime "ask each time" gate.

The extension is **safe by default** when credentials are missing or
mis-configured:

| Situation | Behaviour | Stderr warning? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--profile` not passed | Silent skip. No GitHub tools registered. | No |
| `--profile X`, no `GITHUB_*` env vars at all | Skip. Run continues without GitHub tools. | Yes |
| `--profile X`, partial App creds (e.g. APP_ID set but INSTALLATION_ID missing) | Skip with explicit error. | Yes |
| `--profile X`, App creds set but PEM file unreadable | Skip with explicit error. | Yes |
| `--profile X`, all App creds set and PEM readable | Tools registered. | No |
| `--profile X`, only `GITHUB_TOKEN` set | Tools registered (static-token mode, lower trust). | No |

The `extension_status` JSONL event always reports `status`, `reason`,
`message`, `profile`, and `toolCount` so the orchestrator can log the
outcome programmatically without parsing stderr.

### 5. Model selection

`--model provider/id` (e.g. `anthropic/claude-opus-4-5`, `openai/gpt-4o`).
Credentials come from environment variables (`OPENAI_API_KEY`,
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `FIREWORKS_API_KEY`, …) or Pi's
`~/.pi/agent/auth.json` if you've logged in interactively. Provider/id mapping
is delegated to `@earendil-works/pi-ai`'s `getModel()`.

`--thinking <level>` maps directly to Pi's `thinkingLevel`
(`off`/`minimal`/`low`/`medium`/`high`/`xhigh`). Per-provider effort is
handled by Pi.

**Fireworks AI** is supported out of the box — it's a first-class provider in
`@earendil-works/pi-ai`. Set `FIREWORKS_API_KEY` and select a model with the
`fireworks/` prefix and Fireworks' fully-qualified id:

```bash
echo "summarize this repo" | agentic-pi run \
  --model fireworks/accounts/fireworks/models/glm-5p2 \
  --no-session
```

The provider id is everything after the first `/`, so the `accounts/…` path
(which itself contains slashes) is preserved intact. pi-ai talks to Fireworks
over its Anthropic-compatible endpoint (`https://api.fireworks.ai/inference`),
so tool-calling, streaming, and thinking all work as they do for first-party
Anthropic models.

Models in pi-ai's curated catalog ship with accurate context-window, max-token,
and cost metadata. At the time of writing that includes (run a recent build for
the current list):

| Model | `--model` value |
| --- | --- |
| GLM 5.2 | `fireworks/accounts/fireworks/models/glm-5p2` |
| DeepSeek V4 Pro | `fireworks/accounts/fireworks/models/deepseek-v4-pro` |
| Kimi K2.7 Code | `fireworks/accounts/fireworks/models/kimi-k2p7-code` |
| MiniMax M3 | `fireworks/accounts/fireworks/models/minimax-m3` |
| GPT-OSS 120B | `fireworks/accounts/fireworks/models/gpt-oss-120b` |

> The catalog is curated and shifts each pi-ai release (newer models added,
> retired ones dropped). To use a Fireworks model that isn't curated yet —
> or to correct its metadata — declare it in `~/.pi/agent/models.json` under a
> `fireworks` provider (`api: "anthropic-messages"`, `baseUrl:
> "https://api.fireworks.ai/inference"`, `apiKey: "FIREWORKS_API_KEY"`); see
> Pi's `docs/models.md`. agentic-pi resolves custom models from there
> automatically via Pi's `ModelRegistry`.

**Rate limits & retries.** Pi auto-retries transient model errors — HTTP `429`
(rate limit), `503` (overloaded), other 5xx, and network/timeout — with
exponential backoff (`delay = base · 2^(attempt-1)`), and correctly does *not*
retry terminal quota/billing errors. This is on by default and surfaces as
`auto_retry_start` / `auto_retry_end` events in the JSONL stream.

Pi's stock schedule (3 retries ≈ 14s) is too short for providers that limit on
a **per-minute window** — notably Fireworks, whose TPM limits can take ~60s to
clear, so a burst fails before the window resets. agentic-pi therefore raises
the default to **5 retries at a 4s base → 4s, 8s, 16s, 32s, 64s** (the final
wait alone outlasts a 60s window). Tune per run:

```bash
--max-retries <n>           # attempts (0 disables). e.g. 6
--retry-base-delay-ms <ms>  # backoff base. e.g. 5000 → 5,10,20,40,80s
```

Precedence is **flag → your `retry` block in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` →
agentic-pi's default**, so an explicit settings.json `retry` (including
`retry.provider.*`) is preserved. Programmatic callers pass `maxRetries` /
`retryBaseDelayMs` to `run()`. Pi caps each wait at `retry.maxAgentDelayMs`
(60s by default); unless you set it, agentic-pi raises that cap to the
schedule's final wait so the 64s step is not truncated.

**Prompt-cache warming is off.** Pi can keep a provider's prompt cache warm by
replaying the request during a long tool run (`cacheWarming`, default
`"streaming"` in Pi). Every replay is a billed request, so agentic-pi vetoes it
for a one-shot run. To opt in, set `cacheWarming` in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`
(the only place Pi reads it from); an explicit value is always honoured.

### 6. Defaults that match a containerized sandbox

- **`--no-session`** is intended to be the default in sandboxed runs (state
  lives outside the container).
- **Built-in tools** (read, write, edit, bash, grep, find, ls) are enabled
  by default. Add `--no-builtin-tools` if you want a GitHub-only agent.
- **`AGENTS.md`** in the working directory is auto-loaded as the agent's
  system prompt — same convention Pi uses. Drop your workflow's
  `AGENTS.md` into the mounted workspace and the agent picks it up.

### 7. Optional micro-VM sandboxing via `--sandbox gondolin`

By default Pi's file and bash tools run on the host. Pass `--sandbox gondolin`
and they get routed through a per-run [Gondolin](https://github.com/earendil-works/gondolin)
QEMU micro-VM instead. The orchestrator doesn't need to manage anything —
agentic-pi boots the VM, mounts the working directory at `/workspace`
inside it, runs the agent's tools through it, and tears it down on
`agent_end`.

**What this protects against.** Arbitrary code the agent runs via `bash`
or `write` executes inside the VM, not on the host. A prompt-injection
that gets the agent to `rm -rf /` only rm's the guest, which is thrown
away seconds later. The host workspace is mounted in, so legitimate file
edits *do* persist — destructive `bash` against `/workspace` will still
modify host files (the same trade-off `chroot` and Docker bind mounts
have).

**What this does NOT protect against.** GitHub credentials and the LLM
API key live in the agentic-pi process *outside* the VM. The `github_*`
tools run there. A prompt-injection that subverts Pi into calling
`github_create_issue` does not need to escape the VM — the call happens
host-side. The VM protects against *code execution*, not *tool misuse*.
For protection against tool misuse, restrict the GitHub profile
(`--profile read`).

**Hard requirements.**

- QEMU on the host: `brew install qemu` (macOS) or
  `apt install qemu-system-x86 qemu-system-arm qemu-utils` (Debian/Ubuntu).
- agentic-pi running **natively** on the host, not inside a Docker
  container. See `SPIKE-gondolin.md`: managed-host containers don't
  expose `/dev/kvm`, and macOS Docker uses Apple's
  Virtualization.Framework (not KVM), which is unreachable from inside
  a container.
- On Linux, the running user must have read access to `/dev/kvm`.

**Pre-flight is loud, not silent.** agentic-pi probes for QEMU and
`qemu-img` before starting the VM, and probes the booted VM with
`/bin/true` (5s timeout) before returning. If any check fails, the
process exits 2 with a clean error pointing at the spike doc. The
upstream `VM.create` failure mode of "returns ready but the guest is
dead" cannot leak through.

**Latency cost (measured on macOS Apple Silicon).**

| Op | Time |
| --- | --- |
| First `VM.create` post-boot | ~13 s (one-time cache warm-up) |
| Subsequent `VM.create` | < 100 ms |
| Per-tool overhead | ~200 ms each |
| Realistic shell op (`ls /etc && uname -a`) | ~2.8 s |
| `vm.close` | ~10 ms |

Linux + KVM should be in the same ballpark. Numbers are reproducible
from `test/fixtures/phase3-smoke-sandbox-gondolin.jsonl`.

**Event stream.** A `sandbox_status` JSONL line is emitted right after
the session header. It carries an `envKeys` list (just the keys, never
the values) so consumers can verify which env vars were handed to the VM:

```jsonl
{"type":"sandbox_status","backend":"gondolin","status":{"backend":"gondolin","cwd":"/path/to/workspace","guestPath":"/workspace","createMs":47,"envKeys":["GH_TOKEN","GITHUB_TOKEN"]},"sessionId":"…","timestamp":"…"}
```

If `--sandbox none` (the default), the same line is still emitted with
`backend: "none"` so downstream consumers always know which mode the run
used.

**Passing env into the VM.** Use `--sandbox-env KEY=VAL` on the CLI
(repeatable), or `sandboxEnv: { KEY: "VAL" }` on the programmatic API.
The agent's `bash` calls see these as ordinary environment variables.

When `--profile <github>` is also active and the GitHub extension is
configured, agentic-pi automatically mints a short-lived installation
token via the configured auth backend (App JWT exchange, or static
`GITHUB_TOKEN` passthrough) and injects it as **both** `GITHUB_TOKEN`
and `GH_TOKEN`. Inside the VM, `git push`, `git fetch`, and `gh`
commands work without further setup.

The **App PEM is never copied into the VM** — only the resulting token,
which is short-lived. User-supplied `--sandbox-env GITHUB_TOKEN=…`
overrides the auto-injected value if you need to scope down further.

### 8. Safe web search via the `web-search` extension

agentic-pi can register two native Pi tools — `web_search` and `web_fetch` —
so the agent can do general-purpose research. Backed by a configurable
provider:

| Provider | API key env var | Native content extraction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tavily (default) | `TAVILY_API_KEY` | yes (search + extract) |
| Exa | `EXA_API_KEY` | yes (search + contents) |
| Brave Search | `BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY` | no — `web_fetch` falls back to a safe HTML→text extractor |

**Auto-enable.** When at least one API key env var is present, the
extension is configured automatically. With multiple keys set, priority is
**Tavily → Exa → Brave**; override with `--web-search-provider` or the
`WEB_SEARCH_PROVIDER` env var. Pass `--no-web-search` to suppress the
tools entirely.

**Host-process egress.** Both tools run in the agentic-pi process, **not**
inside the Gondolin guest. That means:

- The provider API host is **not** added to the Gondolin egress
  allowlist, and the API key is **never** injected into the VM.
- Behavior is identical under `--sandbox=none`, `--sandbox=gondolin`, and
  when agentic-pi itself is containerized. The host's own network policy
  controls reachability to the provider + arbitrary http(s) URLs.

**Safety rails (built-in, non-configurable in v1).**

| Rail | Default |
| --- | --- |
| URL scheme allowlist | `http`, `https` only (`web_fetch`) |
| Request timeout | 15 s |
| Max response bytes | 1 MiB (streamed, aborted on overflow) |
| Max redirects | 3 (scheme re-checked at each hop) |
| Content-type gate (`web_fetch`) | `text/*`, `application/(xhtml+xml\|xml\|json)` |
| Max search results | 10 (regardless of `max_results` arg) |
| Extracted text cap | ~200 KiB |
| HTML cleaning | `<script>`, `<style>`, `<noscript>`, `<iframe>`, comments stripped before extraction |
| Per-run call budget | 30 combined `web_search` + `web_fetch` calls (override with `--web-search-max-calls`) |

When the call budget is hit, further invocations return a structured
rate-limit error result so the agent can recover; the run is **not**
aborted.

**No SSRF blocking.** Loopback / private IP ranges are **not** blocked by
default. Operators who care should run agentic-pi behind their own
egress firewall.

**Event stream.** A second `extension_status` event mirrors GitHub's:

```jsonl
{"type":"extension_status","extension":"web-search","status":"configured","provider":"tavily","toolCount":2,"maxCalls":30,"sessionId":"…","timestamp":"…"}
```

When skipped (no keys / `--no-web-search`), `status: "skipped"` carries a
`reason` of `disabled-by-flag` or `no-credentials`. Misconfigurations
(explicit provider whose key is missing, or an unknown provider name)
surface as a warning before the run starts.

### 9. Default file search via FFF

agentic-pi bundles [`@ff-labs/pi-fff`](https://github.com/dmtrKovalenko/fff/tree/main/packages/pi-fff)
— a Rust-backed, git-aware, frecency-ranked, SIMD-accelerated fuzzy file/content
search — as the **default** file-search backend. It ships as a dependency and is
loaded for **every** run with no per-host `pi install` required.

**`override` mode by default.** FFF registers under Pi's built-in tool names
(`find`, `grep`, `multi_grep`), transparently replacing the built-ins. The agent
gets faster, git-aware search with zero prompt changes. Switch behaviour with
`--file-search-mode`:

| Mode | Tool names | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `override` (default) | `find`, `grep`, `multi_grep` | Transparent replacement of Pi's built-ins. |
| `tools-only` | `fffind`, `ffgrep`, `fff-multi-grep` | Added alongside Pi's built-ins; the agent chooses. |
| `tools-and-ui` | same as `tools-only` | Adds `@`-mention autocomplete — useless headless; not recommended. |

The CLI flag maps to FFF's `PI_FFF_MODE` env var. An explicit `PI_FFF_MODE` in the
environment wins over the flag. Pass `--no-file-search` to disable FFF entirely and
fall back to Pi's built-in `find`/`grep`.

**Host-process execution.** Like web search, FFF runs in the agentic-pi process,
**not** inside the Gondolin guest. Under `--sandbox gondolin`, `read`/`write`/`edit`/
`bash` route through the VM while `find`/`grep` (FFF) run host-side against the
bind-mounted workspace. Paths align (cwd is the mount), and FFF only touches the
local filesystem — no egress or secret exposure.

**Native binary.** FFF is a native Rust library (`@ff-labs/fff-node`) shipped as
prebuilt per-platform binaries (`fff-bin-linux-x64-gnu`/`-musl`, `darwin`, `win32`).
npm auto-selects the correct one at install time. In containers, run `npm install`
on the target platform — do **not** copy `node_modules` across glibc↔musl.

**Safe by default.** If pi-fff can't be resolved or its native binary fails to load
on the platform, the run is **not** aborted — file search skips with
`reason: "resolve-failed"` (surfaced as a warning) and the agent falls back to Pi's
built-in `find`/`grep`.

**Event stream.** A third `extension_status` event mirrors the others:

```jsonl
{"type":"extension_status","extension":"file-search","status":"configured","mode":"override","toolCount":3,"sessionId":"…","timestamp":"…"}
```

When disabled or unavailable, `status: "skipped"` carries a `reason` of
`disabled-by-flag` or `resolve-failed`.

### 10. Optional OpenTelemetry export via `--otel`

agentic-pi can export **traces and metrics** for its run to any OTLP-compatible
collector, using the standard OpenTelemetry JS SDK and the standard `OTEL_*`
environment variables. This is meant for orchestrators (e.g. lastlight) that
forward `OTEL_*` config into a sandboxed agentic-pi process so Pi's own activity
shows up in their observability stack.

**Off unless explicitly enabled.** Enablement precedence (highest first):

1. `--no-otel` → force-disabled (wins over everything).
2. `--otel` → enabled.
3. env `AGENTIC_PI_OTEL_ENABLED=1` (when neither flag is passed) → enabled.
4. otherwise → disabled.

A bare `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` does **not** enable telemetry on its own —
enablement is always intentional. Configure the destination with the usual
`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` / `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` /
`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT` (etc.) variables, or `--otel-endpoint` as a
base-URL escape hatch.

**Span tree** (one-shot run → a short-lived root span is correct):

```
agentic_pi.session                 (root; gen_ai.conversation.id = sessionId)
└── agentic_pi.turn
    ├── chat <model>               (per assistant message; tokens, cost, finish reason)
    └── execute_tool <name>        (per tool call; status, duration)
```

**Metrics**: `gen_ai.client.token.usage`, `gen_ai.client.operation.duration`,
`agentic_pi.cost.usd`, `agentic_pi.tool.duration`, `agentic_pi.tool.invocations`,
`agentic_pi.tool.failures`, `agentic_pi.turns`. Attribute names follow the OTEL
GenAI semantic conventions where stable, namespaced under `agentic_pi.*` otherwise.

**Metadata-only by default.** Raw prompt/message/tool-result content is **never**
exported unless you pass `--otel-include-content` (or set
`AGENTIC_PI_OTEL_INCLUDE_CONTENT=1`), in which case content is bounded and
truncated. Metric dimensions are always metadata (bounded cardinality).

**Trace correlation.** If a W3C `TRACEPARENT` env var is present, the session
span is parented to it, so a sandboxed agentic-pi run correlates with the
caller's trace across the process/container boundary.

**Safe by default.** Telemetry never affects the run's exit code, never writes to
stdout/stderr (SDK diagnostics route to the warning channel), and degrades to a
warning if the collector is unreachable. When requested, a final
`extension_status` event mirrors the others:

```jsonl
{"type":"extension_status","extension":"telemetry","status":"configured","includeContent":false,"sessionId":"…","timestamp":"…"}
```

A silent default run (no `--otel`) emits no telemetry event at all.

```bash
# Export to a local collector (e.g. otel-desktop-viewer, Jaeger, Grafana Alloy)
echo "summarize the repo" | OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4318 \
  node dist/cli.js run --model openai/gpt-5.4-nano --otel --no-session
```

### 11. Agent skills (`SKILL.md`)

Pi natively implements the [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io) — the
same `SKILL.md`-in-a-folder convention used by Claude Code and Codex — and
agentic-pi exposes it. A **skill** is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` with YAML
frontmatter (`name` + `description`) and freeform instructions, plus any helper
scripts/references it needs:

```
roll-dice/
└── SKILL.md
```

```markdown
---
name: roll-dice
description: Roll an N-sided die. Use when asked to roll a die or dice.
---

# Roll Dice

Run `echo $((RANDOM % <sides> + 1))`, replacing `<sides>` with the die size.
```

**Progressive disclosure.** At startup Pi scans the skill locations and puts only
each skill's `name` + `description` into the system prompt. When a task matches, the
agent `read`s the full `SKILL.md` on demand, then loads any referenced scripts/assets
by relative path. This keeps the prompt small while making many skills available.

**Default locations — already discovered, no flag needed.** Drop a skill into any of:

- Global: `~/.pi/agent/skills/`, `~/.agents/skills/`
- Project (cwd + ancestors to git root): `.pi/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`
- Packages: a `skills/` directory or `pi.skills` entry in a dependency's `package.json`

**Mapping an existing skills folder via `--skill`.** To use skills you already keep
elsewhere — e.g. your Claude Code skills, or a directory mounted into a CI container —
point at it with `--skill <path>` (repeatable; accepts a directory of skills or a
single skill). It's **additive even with `--no-skills`**:

```bash
# Map your Claude Code skills directory straight into the agent
echo "use the roll-dice skill to roll a d20" | node dist/cli.js run \
  --model openai/gpt-5.4-nano --no-session --skill ~/.claude/skills

# Load ONLY an explicit folder; suppress all default discovery
... --no-skills --skill ./ci-skills

# Turn skills off entirely
... --no-skills
```

Programmatic callers pass `skillPaths: string[]` / `noSkills: boolean` to `run()`.

**Cross-harness reuse via settings.** Instead of a flag on every run, list skill
directories in a Pi `settings.json` (under the agent dir) so they always load:

```json
{
  "skills": ["~/.claude/skills", "~/.codex/skills"]
}
```

**One-shot caveat.** agentic-pi has no interactive mode, so Pi's `/skill:name` slash
command doesn't apply here — skills are **model-invoked** from the catalog. If the
model doesn't pick up a skill on its own, name it in the prompt ("use the `roll-dice`
skill …") to nudge it to load the `SKILL.md`.

**Safe by default.** A `--skill` path that doesn't exist is dropped with a warning
rather than aborting the run. Skills are a Pi-native *resource* (fed to the resource
loader), not agentic-pi tools, so they don't appear in the `extension_status` events.

**Observability.** Pi emits no skill-specific event, and skill *usage* only shows up
indirectly — when the agent loads a skill it `read`s the `SKILL.md`, so it surfaces as
a normal `tool_execution_start`/`_end` whose `args.path` ends in `SKILL.md`. To make
*discovery* visible, agentic-pi synthesizes a single `skills_status` event at startup:

```jsonl
{"type":"skills_status","status":"configured","discovered":2,"skills":[{"name":"roll-dice","source":"/abs/roll-dice/SKILL.md","modelInvocable":true}],"mappedPaths":["/abs/skills"],"noSkills":false,"sessionId":"…","timestamp":"…"}
```

`status` is `default` (no flags), `configured` (`--skill` paths resolved), or
`disabled` (`--no-skills`). `modelInvocable` is `false` for skills that set
`disable-model-invocation: true` (present but never auto-loaded). The event is
**gated**: a default run that discovers no skills emits nothing, so the golden JSONL
fixtures stay byte-identical. Programmatic callers read the same data from
`result.skills`.

> **Security:** a skill can instruct the model to take any action and may bundle code
> the model runs. Only map skill directories you trust.

## When to use this

- You have an orchestrator that calls a coding agent once per workflow
  phase, in a container, and parses a JSONL stream.
- You need GitHub repo operations available to the agent without standing
  up an MCP server.
- You want safe, sandbox-mode-agnostic web search available to the agent.

## When **not** to use this

- You want a chat UI or a long-running agent. Use [`pi`](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi)
  directly — its interactive and RPC modes are excellent.
- You want generic MCP support. Pi has none by design and agentic-pi inherits
  that decision; only the GitHub tool surface is built-in.
- You want a different tool surface (Linear, GitLab, internal APIs). Fork the
  `extensions/github/` directory as a template. agentic-pi bundles specific Pi
  extensions (GitHub, web search, FFF file search) but does not (yet) load
  arbitrary operator-supplied extensions as a runtime plugin system.

## Usage

```bash
echo "list open PRs on owner/repo" | agentic-pi run \
  --model anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5 \
  --profile read \
  --no-session
```

Required env (one of):

```bash
# Model provider — at least one matching your --model
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-…
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-…
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-…
FIREWORKS_API_KEY=fw-…

# GitHub — App credentials preferred over static token
GITHUB_APP_ID=…
GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=/abs/path/app.pem
GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID=…
# or, for low-trust fallback:
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_…
```

## Flags

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--model <provider/id>` | Required. e.g. `anthropic/claude-opus-4-5`, `openai/gpt-4o`, `fireworks/accounts/fireworks/models/glm-5p2`. See section 5. |
| `--thinking <level>` | `off` \| `minimal` \| `low` \| `medium` \| `high` \| `xhigh`. |
| `--profile <name>` | `read` \| `issues-write` \| `review-write` \| `repo-write`. Omit to disable GitHub tools entirely. |
| `--cwd <path>` | Working directory for the agent. Default: `$PWD`. |
| `--no-session` | Ephemeral run — do not persist session jsonl. Recommended in sandboxed containers. |
| `--session-dir <path>` | Override session storage location. |
| `--no-builtin-tools` | Disable Pi's `read,write,edit,bash,grep,find,ls`. |
| `--tools <a,b,c>` | Explicit tool allowlist (combined with profile if set). |
| `--sandbox <none\|gondolin>` | Route `read`/`write`/`edit`/`bash` through a sandbox backend. Default `none`. `gondolin` boots a QEMU micro-VM mounting cwd at `/workspace`. Requires QEMU on the host; native-only (not Docker-in-Docker). See section 7. |
| `--sandbox-env KEY=VAL` | Inject env var into the sandbox VM (repeatable). Ignored when `--sandbox=none`. Auto-injects a minted `GITHUB_TOKEN`/`GH_TOKEN` when `--profile` is also active. |
| `--allow-host <host>` | Add host to the sandbox HTTP egress allowlist (repeatable). Ignored when `--sandbox=none`. |
| `--no-network` | Disable sandbox HTTP egress entirely. Ignored when `--sandbox=none`. |
| `--web-search-provider <p>` | Force web-search provider: `tavily` \| `brave` \| `exa`. Default: auto-detect by env. See section 8. |
| `--no-web-search` | Disable the web-search extension (no `web_search`/`web_fetch` tools). |
| `--no-file-search` | Disable the bundled FFF file-search extension; fall back to Pi's built-in `find`/`grep`. |
| `--file-search-mode <m>` | FFF mode: `override` (default) \| `tools-only` \| `tools-and-ui`. Overridden by the `PI_FFF_MODE` env var. See section 9. |
| `--skill <path>` | Load Agent Skills from `<path>` (a skills dir or a single skill). Repeatable; additive even with `--no-skills`. Maps e.g. `~/.claude/skills` into the agent. Default-location skills load without this. See section 11. |
| `--no-skills` | Disable Pi's default skill discovery. Explicit `--skill` paths still load. |
| `--max-retries <n>` | Max auto-retry attempts for transient model errors (429/503/5xx/network). Exponential backoff; `0` disables. Default tuned for per-minute rate-limit windows (e.g. Fireworks TPM). Overrides `retry.maxRetries` in settings.json. See section 5. |
| `--retry-base-delay-ms <n>` | Backoff base in ms: `delay = base·2^(attempt-1)`. Overrides `retry.baseDelayMs` in settings.json. |
| `--web-search-max-calls <n>` | Cap combined `web_search` + `web_fetch` calls per run. Default: 30. |
| `--max-steps <n>` | Hard cap on agent steps (one LLM turn + its tool calls). When reached while the agent still wants to continue, the run stops and emits a `max_steps_reached` event before `agent_end`. Default: no cap. |
| `--gate-timeout <seconds>` | Timeout for gate commands (installs, builds, full test suites). Adds one bash-tool guideline telling the model to pass this `timeout`, redirect output to a log and judge by exit code, and not to retry a timed-out gate; a smaller model timeout on a recognised gate command (`pnpm test`, `vitest`, `turbo run`, …) is raised to it. Programmatic: `gateTimeoutSeconds`. Default: unset (no guidance, no change). Works with `--sandbox gondolin` too. |
| `--otel` | Enable OpenTelemetry traces + metrics export. Off by default. Requires an OTLP endpoint via `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` (or `--otel-endpoint`). See section 10. |
| `--no-otel` | Force-disable OTEL even if `AGENTIC_PI_OTEL_ENABLED=1`. |
| `--otel-include-content` | Attach prompt/message/tool content to spans (bounded + truncated). Default: metadata-only. |
| `--otel-service-name <n>` | Override `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` (default: `agentic-pi`). |
| `--otel-endpoint <url>` | Override `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` base URL. |
| `--providers <json>` | Point providers at a different endpoint — a self-hosted or corporate LLM gateway rather than the vendor. `{"anthropic":{"baseUrl":"https://gw.internal/anthropic"}}` is enough for a provider pi knows (models, auth and request shape are inherited); one it doesn't also needs `"api"` (`openai-completions` \| `anthropic-messages`) and `"apiKeyEnv"`, and its model is registered on the fly with zero cost rates, since a gateway publishes no price list. Env fallback: `AGENTIC_PI_PROVIDERS` — the route into a run executing inside a container. |
| `--command-policy <json>` | Allow, log or block classes of bash command: `{"install":"block","test":"log"}`. Classes: `install` (npm/pnpm/yarn/bun, pip/uv/poetry, bundle/gem, cargo, go, composer, dotnet, maven/gradle, system package managers), `install-scratch` (an install whose directory — a `cd` before it, `--prefix`/`-C`/`--dir`, or `-g` — is outside the cwd; falls back to `install`'s mode), and `test` (test runners plus `npm test` / `run test|lint|typecheck` scripts). `log` runs the command and emits a `command_policy` event; `block` refuses it, the model gets the reason as the tool result, and the event is emitted too. `"reason"` replaces the default block text. Matching is per segment (split on `&&`, `;`, `\|`, newlines) after stripping `cd`, env assignments, `env`, `timeout`, `time`, `nice`, `sudo`. A pattern guard, not a security boundary. Programmatic: `commandPolicy`. Env fallback: `AGENTIC_PI_COMMAND_POLICY`. Default: unset (everything runs, no events). |

Reads the prompt from stdin. Emits JSONL on stdout. Exits 0 on `agent_end`,
1 on fatal error.

## Event stream

```jsonl
{"type":"session","version":3,"id":"<uuid>","timestamp":"…","cwd":"…"}
{"type":"sandbox_status","backend":"none","status":{"backend":"none"},"sessionId":"<uuid>","timestamp":"…"}
{"type":"extension_status","extension":"github","status":"configured","profile":"read","toolCount":18,"sessionId":"<uuid>","timestamp":"…"}
{"type":"extension_status","extension":"web-search","status":"configured","provider":"tavily","toolCount":2,"maxCalls":30,"sessionId":"<uuid>","timestamp":"…"}
{"type":"extension_status","extension":"file-search","status":"configured","mode":"override","toolCount":3,"sessionId":"<uuid>","timestamp":"…"}
{"type":"skills_status","status":"configured","discovered":1,"skills":[{"name":"roll-dice","source":"…/SKILL.md","modelInvocable":true}],"mappedPaths":["…"],"noSkills":false,"sessionId":"<uuid>","timestamp":"…"}
{"type":"agent_start","sessionId":"<uuid>","timestamp":"…"}
{"type":"turn_start","sessionId":"<uuid>","timestamp":"…"}
{"type":"message_start","message":{"role":"system","content":"","sections":{"preamble":"…","tools":"…","rules":"…","docs":"…","cwd":"…"},"toolsAdded":[…]},"sessionId":"<uuid>","timestamp":"…"}
{"type":"message_end","message":{"role":"system",…},"sessionId":"<uuid>","timestamp":"…"}
{"type":"message_start","message":{…},"sessionId":"<uuid>","timestamp":"…"}
{"type":"message_update","assistantMessageEvent":{"type":"text_delta","delta":"…"},"sessionId":"<uuid>","timestamp":"…"}
{"type":"tool_execution_start","toolCallId":"…","toolName":"github_list_pull_requests","args":{…},"sessionId":"<uuid>","timestamp":"…"}
{"type":"tool_execution_end","toolCallId":"…","toolName":"github_list_pull_requests","result":{"content":[…]},"isError":false,"sessionId":"<uuid>","timestamp":"…"}
{"type":"message_end","message":{…},"sessionId":"<uuid>","timestamp":"…"}
{"type":"turn_end","message":{…},"toolResults":[…],"sessionId":"<uuid>","timestamp":"…"}
{"type":"agent_end","messages":[…],"willRetry":false,"sessionId":"<uuid>","timestamp":"…"}
{"type":"usage_snapshot","stats":{"userMessages":1,"assistantMessages":2,"toolCalls":1,"toolResults":1,"tokens":{"input":…,"output":…,"cacheRead":…,"cacheWrite":…,"total":…},"cost":0.000…},"sessionId":"<uuid>","timestamp":"…"}
```

The first message pair carries the **system prompt** (`role: "system"`, Pi
0.86+): the base `content`, its named `sections`, and the tools the model was
given (`toolsAdded`; a later system message may carry `toolsRemoved` or replace
a section). Assistant messages carry `stopReason` plus, where the provider
reports them, `rawStopReason` (the provider's own reason), `responseModel` (what
actually served the turn) and `providerThinkingLevel`.

`extension_status` is emitted once at startup so downstream logs can confirm
the GitHub profile (and whether auth succeeded). `skills_status` is emitted once
at startup too, but **only** when skills were configured or discovered (section 11) —
a default run with no skills omits it entirely. `usage_snapshot` is always the last
line in a successful run.

When `--max-steps`/`maxSteps` is set and the agent hits the cap (it finished
that many turns and still wanted to keep going), a `max_steps_reached` event is
emitted just before `agent_end`, the run is stopped, and `result.maxStepsReached`
is set. It's never emitted when the agent finishes on its own — so a run that
stays under the cap (or sets none) keeps the byte-identical default stream above.

```jsonl
{"type":"max_steps_reached","maxSteps":8,"steps":8,"sessionId":"<uuid>","timestamp":"…"}
```

When `--command-policy`/`commandPolicy` logs or blocks a bash call, one
`command_policy` event is emitted per matched class, before the tool runs (or is
refused). A run with no policy, or one that never matches, emits none.

```jsonl
{"type":"command_policy","action":"block","class":"install","pattern":"js-install","command":"npm ci && npm test","sessionId":"<uuid>","timestamp":"…"}
```

## Programmatic usage

If your orchestrator runs Node, you can skip the subprocess and import
agentic-pi directly. The `run()` API never touches `process.stdout` or
`process.stderr` — it returns a fully-derived `RunResult` and forwards
events through callbacks instead.

```ts
import { run } from "agentic-pi";

const result = await run({
  model: "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5",
  prompt: "list the open PRs on owner/repo and summarize them",
  thinking: "medium",
  profile: "read",
  sandbox: "none",
  noSession: true,
  cwd: "/path/to/workspace",

  // Per-run env handed to the sandbox VM. Ignored when sandbox="none".
  // When sandbox="gondolin" + profile is set, GITHUB_TOKEN/GH_TOKEN are
  // auto-injected from a minted installation token — explicit values
  // here win.
  sandboxEnv: {
    CI_BUILD_REF: process.env.GITHUB_SHA ?? "",
  },

  // This run's GitHub credential, REPLACING process.env for the github_*
  // tools. Pass it whenever runs can overlap in one process — see
  // "Notes for in-process callers".
  githubAuthEnv: { GITHUB_TOKEN: scopedTokenForThisRun },

  // Optional observability hooks. Both are pure callbacks — no I/O happens
  // unless you do something with the values.
  onEvent: (record) => myShim.writeJsonl(record),
  onWarn: (msg) => myLogger.warn(msg),
});

if (!result.ok) {
  throw new Error(result.fatalError?.message ?? "agent failed");
}

console.log(result.finalText);           // "There are 3 open PRs: …"
console.log(result.sessionId);           // Pi session UUID
console.log(result.stats?.tokens.total); // total tokens
console.log(result.stats?.cost);         // USD
console.log(result.sandbox?.backend);    // "none" | "gondolin"
console.log(result.github?.status);      // "configured" | "skipped"
console.log(result.records.length);      // full event log
```

### `RunResult` shape

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `exitCode` | `0 \| 1 \| 2` | Same code the CLI would have returned. |
| `ok` | `boolean` | `exitCode === 0`. |
| `agentEnded` | `boolean` | Pi emitted `agent_end`. |
| `toolErrors` | `boolean` | At least one tool returned an error. |
| `maxStepsReached` | `boolean` | Run was stopped because it hit the `maxSteps` cap (agent still wanted to continue). `false` when it finished on its own or no cap was set. |
| `fatalError` | `{name, message}` \| `undefined` | Set if a fatal error short-circuited the run. |
| `sessionId` | `string` \| `undefined` | Pi session UUID. |
| `cwd` | `string` \| `undefined` | Working directory the agent ran in. |
| `startedAt` | `string` \| `undefined` | ISO timestamp of session start. |
| `finalText` | `string` | Concatenated last-assistant text content. |
| `messages` | `unknown[]` | Full Pi message array from `agent_end`. |
| `stats` | `{userMessages, assistantMessages, toolCalls, toolResults, tokens: {input, output, cacheRead, cacheWrite, total}, cost}` \| `undefined` | Token + cost rollup. |
| `sandbox` | `{backend, status}` \| `undefined` | Mirror of the `sandbox_status` event. |
| `github` | `{status, reason, profile, toolCount}` \| `undefined` | Mirror of the GitHub `extension_status` event. |
| `webSearch` | `{status, reason, provider, toolCount, maxCalls}` \| `undefined` | Mirror of the web-search `extension_status` event. |
| `fileSearch` | `{status, reason, mode, toolCount}` \| `undefined` | Mirror of the FFF file-search `extension_status` event. |
| `skills` | `{status, discovered, skills: {name, source, modelInvocable}[], mappedPaths, noSkills}` \| `undefined` | Mirror of the `skills_status` event. Absent when none configured/discovered (section 11). |
| `records` | `EmitterRecord[]` | Every JSONL record in order. Same shape that the CLI writes. |
| `warnings` | `string[]` | Warnings that would have gone to stderr in CLI mode. |

### When to use which API

| If you want… | Use |
| --- | --- |
| The same observable stream the CLI produces, captured to a file or proxied to a UI | `run({ ..., onEvent })` |
| A single object describing the outcome (lastlight's `ExecutionResult` mapping) | `run()` and read `result.finalText`/`result.stats` |
| Direct control over the sink (e.g. write straight to a writable stream you already have) | `run({ ..., extraSink })` or drop down to `runOnce(config, prompt, { sink, onWarn })` |
| Cancellation | Not supported yet — kill the host process. Open an issue if you need this. |

### Notes for in-process callers

- agentic-pi reads the host process's env vars (`OPENAI_API_KEY`,
  `GITHUB_APP_ID`, …) for anything not passed explicitly.
- **Do not vary GitHub credentials through `process.env` when runs can
  overlap.** `process.env` is one global: a token written there for run A is
  visible to run B, and the extension reads it *late* (after the model runtime
  and registry are built), so B can capture A's token — wrong repo, and
  read-only if A's profile was narrower, which surfaces as every `github_*`
  write failing with `403 Resource not accessible by integration` while `git`
  keeps working. Interleaved restores can also leave the host env permanently
  wrong. Pass **`githubAuthEnv`** instead: it replaces `process.env` for that
  run, so each concurrent run gets exactly the credential you handed it (and
  the host's App PEM can't leak into a run given a downscoped token).

  ```ts
  await Promise.all([
    run({ ...a, profile: "repo-write", githubAuthEnv: { GITHUB_TOKEN: tokenA } }),
    run({ ...b, profile: "read",       githubAuthEnv: { GITHUB_TOKEN: tokenB } }),
  ]);
  ```

- `cwd` is per-call; you can run multiple agents in parallel against
  different working directories from the same orchestrator process.
- Sessions are created fresh each call. Pass `noSession: true` if you
  don't want session JSONLs accumulating under `~/.pi/agent/sessions/`.
- The sandbox boots and tears down per call. If you're processing many
  short tasks against the same workspace, the per-task VM cost adds up;
  consider batching or just leaving `sandbox: "none"`.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm test                 # unit only (same as test:unit) — integration tests never run by default
npm run test:unit        # unit only (fast, no API keys, no QEMU)
npm run test:integration # integration only (needs OPENAI_API_KEY; sandbox also needs QEMU)

echo "hello" | node dist/cli.js run --model anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5 --no-session
```

### Tests

The test suite uses Node's built-in test runner (`node:test`) and `tsx`
to load TypeScript. Files are discovered by `scripts/run-tests.mjs`,
which walks `test/` for `*.test.ts`.

| File | What it covers | Skip condition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `test/args.test.ts` | CLI flag parsing happy path + every error case | — |
| `test/emitter.test.ts` | `Emitter`, `CollectorSink`, `TeeSink` contracts | — |
| `test/models.test.ts` | `provider/id` parsing including openrouter triple-slash | — |
| `test/extensions/github/profiles.test.ts` | Profile → tool allowlist (counts, superset structure, scope tiering) | — |
| `test/extensions/github/credentials.test.ts` | `gitAuthEnv` / `http.extraheader` construction + github.com scoping (verified via `git config --get-urlmatch`) | — |
| `test/extensions/web-search/*.test.ts` | Provider selection, extension wiring, safe-fetch rails, HTML extraction, rate limiter, per-provider normalization (all with injected `fetchImpl`) | — |
| `test/extensions/file-search/index.test.ts` | FFF extension wiring: mode → tool names, package resolution, disabled-by-flag + resolve-failed skips | — |
| `test/sandbox/preflight.test.ts` | Preflight returns a structured ok\|error result | — |
| `test/run.integration.test.ts` | Programmatic `run()`: RunResult populated, onEvent fires for every record, **child-process check confirms zero stdout/stderr leak from library** | `OPENAI_API_KEY` not set |
| `test/run-sandbox.integration.test.ts` | `run({ sandbox: "gondolin" })` boots a VM, agent's `write` tool produces a host file via the mount | `OPENAI_API_KEY` not set OR QEMU/preflight unavailable |

Unit tests run in ~170 ms. Integration tests cost about $0.001 per run on
`gpt-5.4-nano`.

## Releasing

agentic-pi publishes to npm via a GitHub Actions workflow using **npm
trusted publishing** (OIDC) — no `NPM_TOKEN` secret is needed in the
repo.

To cut a release:

1. Bump `version` in `package.json` — `npm version patch` (or `minor` /
   `major`) does the version bump, the commit, and the tag in one step.
2. Push the commit and tag: `git push --follow-tags`. CI runs against
   the version-bump commit on `main`.
3. Create a GitHub Release on the new tag once CI is green:
   `gh release create v0.2.0 --generate-notes` or via the web UI.
4. The `publish.yml` workflow runs on the `release: published` event —
   this is the only auto-trigger. (CI does not re-run; `publish.yml`
   re-validates type-check, build, and unit tests itself so nothing is
   skipped.)

`publish.yml` also accepts a manual `workflow_dispatch` with an explicit
tag/ref — useful if a release-triggered run failed (network, OIDC config
not yet set up) and you want to retry without re-cutting the release.

The publish step fails if the tag (or the dispatch `ref` input) doesn't
match `package.json` version — there is no path that publishes a version
not represented in the repo at that exact commit.

### One-time setup (trusted publisher)

The first publish of a package needs to be done manually; subsequent
ones go through the workflow. To enable OIDC for this repo's publishes:

1. Visit the package's "Trusted Publishers" page on
   <https://www.npmjs.com/package/agentic-pi/settings>.
2. Add a GitHub Actions trusted publisher with:
   - Organization: `nearform`
   - Repository: `agentic-pi`
   - Workflow filename: `publish.yml`
   - Environment: leave empty (the workflow doesn't use one)

After that, every tag push triggers a workflow that mints an OIDC token,
npm verifies it against the configured publisher, and the publish goes
through with a [provenance statement](https://docs.npmjs.com/generating-provenance-statements)
attached.

## Status & relationship to Pi

agentic-pi pins to `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent ^0.75.4`. It uses Pi's SDK
in-process (`createAgentSession`, `session.subscribe`, `session.prompt`,
`session.getSessionStats`) — not the CLI subprocess. If Pi's SDK changes shape,
agentic-pi will need to track it; that's the trade-off taken for in-process
speed and direct access to session state.

It does **not** wrap, fork, or modify Pi. Pi's defaults that we don't
override remain in effect: AGENTS.md auto-discovery, ~/.pi/agent skills /
extensions / prompts / themes, the same model registry, the same auth
storage. If you `pi /login` and authenticate via subscription, agentic-pi
will pick that up too.
