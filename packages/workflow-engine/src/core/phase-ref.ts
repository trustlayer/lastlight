/**
 * The single authority for building and resolving the phase labels the runner
 * generates for loop iterations.
 *
 * A workflow phase named in the YAML (e.g. `reviewer`) keeps that bare name for
 * its initial run. When a reviewer loop fixes-and-rechecks, or a generic loop
 * iterates, the runner mints a derived label. `PhaseRef.format()` is the ONLY
 * place those derived strings are constructed, and `PhaseRef.parse()` resolves
 * them back to their base phase + kind.
 *
 * Scheme (post-#93):
 *
 *   initial review            → reviewer
 *   cycle n fix               → reviewer_fix_n
 *   cycle n re-review         → reviewer_recheck_n
 *   generic-loop iteration n  → reviewer_iter_n
 *   generic-loop retry of n   → reviewer_iter_n_retry
 *   generic-loop check of n   → reviewer_iter_n_check
 *   fan-out branch b          → survey_branch_b
 *   fan-out branch b's retry  → survey_branch_b_retry
 *   fan-out branch b's check  → survey_branch_b_check
 *
 * `n` is the 1-based cycle; `fix_k` and `recheck_k` pair within a cycle. The
 * `_retry` suffix is the one-shot re-run of a generic-loop iteration whose first
 * attempt came back empty (a "soft" outcome); it gets its own ledger row so
 * resume/dedup doesn't skip it, and the dashboard's longest-prefix grouping
 * still nests it under the same parent. The `_check` suffix is the
 * `generic_loop.until_bash` exit-condition run for iteration n — a real sandbox
 * command that can take minutes, so it gets its own ledger row too and is
 * therefore visible (with a start time and a duration) while it is in flight.
 * The legacy bare-numeric re-review form (`reviewer_2`) is dropped entirely —
 * it is neither produced nor recognized.
 *
 * The three `_branch_` forms are a `type: fanout` phase's branches (WP11c). A
 * fan-out is ONE dag node running N agent sessions concurrently in one
 * provisioned workspace, so the node has one name but N units of work — and each
 * unit needs its own `executions` row for resume, dedup and cost attribution.
 * Keyed by NAME rather than index because a branch is declared, not counted:
 * reordering the `branches:` list must not re-key the ledger and make a resumed
 * run re-pay for work it already did. Branch names are constrained by the schema
 * to `[A-Za-z0-9-]` precisely so these three patterns parse unambiguously
 * against a base that may itself contain underscores.
