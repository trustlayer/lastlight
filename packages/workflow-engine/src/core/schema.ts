   *     (the last is needed to comment on a PR at all). Workflows that read the
   *     repo and post a findings/answer/demo comment but never push code.

   *     `per-target-reuse`, but a *different*-run marker triggers a delete +
   *     fresh clone off the DEFAULT branch, not a `git fetch`/reset of the

   *     not merely *refresh* a stale checkout — that would reset onto the old

   *     returns undefined for it and a `demo`-classified message falls through
   *     to plain chat. Advertising it would send users at a dead route.
   *   - `dependabot-ci-fix` / `dependabot-pr-merge` are genuinely reachable from
   *     a Slack message (they're outside `WELL_KNOWN_INTENTS`, so the `default:`
   *     fallback dispatches them) but would arrive with a repo and no PR number.
   *     Nobody should be told to type those.
   *
   * So the gate is the presence of THIS block and nothing else — `classification:`
   * is not consulted. Absence means silence, which is the right default for those
   * three plus every workflow with no `classification:` at all (`pr-fix`, the
   * crons). Consumed by `assembleChatPrompt()` in
   * `src/engine/chat/chat-prompt.ts`, which composes the chat system prompt from
   * the ENABLED workflow set the way `assembleClassifier()` composes the
   * classifier prompt (issue #164) — so an overlay workflow that declares this
   * gets advertised with no core edit, and one an operator disables stops being
   * advertised.

// ── Cron workflow ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Cron workflows are NOT runnable themselves — they describe a schedule that
// triggers WORK. That work is one of exactly two things, and a definition names
// precisely one of them:
//
//   `workflow:` — the name of an AgentWorkflow to dispatch on each tick. The
//                 normal case: the tick fans out one sandboxed agent run per
//                 managed repo.
//   `handler:`  — the name of a HOST-SIDE handler, resolved at boot against a
//                 registry the runtime supplies. No sandbox, no agent, no run
//                 row: the handler is plain code in the harness process.
//
// `handler:` exists because some periodic work is structurally un-agentable.
// The repo digest is the motivating case: its facts live in the harness's own
// SQLite (which a sandboxed phase cannot reach) and it posts to Slack (which no
// agent has a tool for). Such a cron could be registered with the scheduler's
// `registerDirect`, as the sandbox sweep and feedback poll are — but a direct
// job is invisible to `getCronWorkflows()`, so it gets no dashboard toggle, no
// `cron_overrides` schedule, no per-repo participation and, worst of all, no
// "Run now". Declaring it here buys all of that for the cost of one field.
//
// (Previously this carried a `skill` field referencing the legacy executeSkill
// path; that path no longer exists.)
