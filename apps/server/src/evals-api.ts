/**
 * Public API barrel for `lastlight-evals` (and any external harness that drives
 * Last Light's real workflows out of process).
 *
 * This is the ENTIRE supported surface for running a workflow against mocked
 * GitHub: the four workflow symbols the eval harness needs, plus the overlay
 * bootstrap helpers it reuses to scaffold a fresh evals/overlay repo.
 *
 * Consumers import from `"lastlight/evals"` (see the `exports` map in
 * package.json) — never deep `lastlight/dist/...` paths — so core's internal
 * file layout can change without breaking them.
 *
 * The mock seam is `ExecutorConfig.githubApiBaseUrl`: point it at an in-process
 * fake GitHub and every `github_*` tool call is redirected there. Approval
 * gates are inert when `runWorkflow` is called without a `db`/`approvalConfig`.

// `runWorkflow`'s repo-config parameter. `invalidateRepoLayer` is exported
// because the fetch is cached per repo with a ~60s TTL — an A/B across two

// ── the PR state machine (issues #251, #252) ────────────────────────────────
//
// A harness driving a PR-scoped workflow (`pr-fix`, `dependabot-ci-fix`,
// `dependabot-pr-merge`, `pr-review`) has the same problem the repo-config
// block above solves: in production those workflows are dispatched, never
// called directly, and `dispatchWorkflow` resolves ONE `PrState` snapshot and
// projects it into the template context. Every variable the fix and merge
// prompts render — `{{ciSection}}`, `{{attempt}}`, `{{mayMerge}}`,
// `{{priorNotes}}`, `{{verifyScript}}` — comes from that projection.
//
// So a harness that builds its own context by hand runs those workflows blind:
// not a smaller version of production, a DIFFERENT one, with every `{{#if}}`
// guard taking the empty branch. `renderContext` is exported so it can supply
// the snapshot (which it must fabricate — there is no real PR) and let CORE do
// the projection, exactly as `resolveRepoRunConfig` above lets core do the
// per-repo merge. The alternative is a second copy of the projection in the
// harness, free to drift from what ships.
//
// `mayMerge` and the marker parsers ride along because they are the other half
// of the same job: the merge gate's verdict is projected by `renderContext`,
// and what a run CONCLUDED is a marker line in the phase output, which only
// these parsers read correctly (`lastMarkerLine` recognises `<TAG>:`, not a
// bare mention — see `fix-markers.ts`).

// The `spec` axis's two ends, and the client that reads them.
//
// `renderContext` above projects a snapshot the harness FABRICATES. That is the
// right shape for `{{ciSection}}` and friends — there is no real PR — but it is
// the wrong shape for `PrState.closes` / `.changedFiles`, because those are not
// facts a case declares: they are facts GitHub COMPUTES. `closes` in particular
// is `closingIssuesReferences`, which resolves both the body's closing keywords
// and issues linked by hand through the Development sidebar. A harness that
// seeds them re-implements that resolution, and a harness that seeds only one of
// them silences the whole family — `buildSpecObligations` refuses a one-ended
// seed, because IRIS measured a half mechanism at −3, WORSE than no seed at all.
//
// Both failures happened, one end at a time. So the enrichment step itself is
// exported: the harness points a real `GitHubClient` at its fake GitHub and
// core's own `resolveSpecContext` does both reads, exactly as `dispatchWorkflow`
// does at the choke point. The fake grows the GraphQL route rather than the
// harness growing a copy of the resolver — its stated convention, and the same
// call it already made for `enablePullRequestAutoMerge`.
