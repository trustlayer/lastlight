/**
 * The review DEPTH marker — parsed, and harvested onto the run's scratch
 * (issue #378).
 *
 * `prompts/review-triage.md` asks the triage phase to end with exactly one
 * machine-readable line:
 *
 * ```
 * REVIEW_DEPTH: full | light
 * ```
 *
 * That one line is the whole tier mechanism. It is written to
 * `scratch.reviewTriage`, the scheduler re-reads the run row's scratch at the
 * top of every scheduling pass, and the seven evidence-pipeline phases carry
 * `skip_if: "scratch.reviewTriage.depth == 'light'"`. Scratch rather than
 * `{{phaseOutputs}}` because scratch is durable across a resume and phase
 * outputs are not — a run that pauses for an approval gate and is picked back
 * up would otherwise re-run the full pipeline it had just decided to skip.
 *
 * Modelled on the pure/impure split of `./fix-markers.ts` + `./fix-harvest.ts`,
 * and it inherits both traps that module's header documents:
 *
 * - **`phase` is a LABEL, not a phase name.** A loop iteration arrives as
 *   `triage_iter_1`, a soft retry as `triage_iter_1_retry`. Nothing here keys
 *   on the label — the marker line is self-identifying, so every phase of the
 *   run is scanned and the LAST marker wins, which is also the right answer for
 *   a loop.
 * - **`mergeScratch` is a TOP-LEVEL shallow merge.** The namespace is written
 *   whole, never patched leaf-by-leaf.
 *
 * ## Why `light` REPLACES the namespace
 *
 * `runner.ts` seeds `{ depth: "full", baseline: true }` at run start, and
 * exactly one of `baseline` / `light` must be true so exactly one arm of
 * `prompts/review.md` renders — the template engine has no `else` and no
 * nesting, so mutually exclusive keys are how a choice is expressed. Writing
 * `{ depth: "light", light: true }` over the seed clears `baseline` — and
 * `skipReview` — by replacement.
 *
 * ## Failure direction
 *
 * Every one of them is "full review". A malformed marker, an unrecognised
 * value, a phase that emitted nothing, a harvest that threw — all leave the
 * dispatch-time seed standing.
