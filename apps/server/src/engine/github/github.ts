   * Remove ONE label from an issue/PR, leaving every other label alone.
   *
   * The second of the two harness-side label writes (see {@link addLabels}),
   * and the load-bearing half of the software-factory stage pipeline: the
   * stage label IS the source of truth for where an issue has got to, and the
   * ENTRY label (`ready-for-agent`) must come off BEFORE the run it triggered
   * starts. That ordering is not cosmetic. The backstop cron sweep finds work
   * by querying `label:ready-for-agent`; if the label is still there while the
   * run is in flight, the sweep is structurally able to re-pick an issue that
   * was already dispatched, and re-pick it again on the next tick. This repo
   * has a recorded production incident of exactly that shape — a cron gated on
   * a signal the work never wrote, every run reporting `succeeded` while it
   * burned roughly $1.30/hour. Removing the entry label at dispatch is what
   * makes the re-pick impossible rather than merely unlikely.
   *
   * **A missing label is a 404, and a 404 here is success.** GitHub answers
   * `404` when the label is not on the issue (and also when the label does not
   * exist in the repo at all). Either way the desired end state — "this label
   * is not on this issue" — already holds, so removing an absent label is a
   * no-op and we swallow that ONE status. Everything else (403 from a
   * downscoped token, 5xx, a network failure) propagates: a blanket catch here
   * would turn "we could not take the entry label off" into silence, which is
   * precisely the re-dispatch loop above.

   * ## The rate-limit budget is what decides this method's shape
   *
   * The obvious implementation — `issues.listForRepo` per repo, per poll — does
   * not survive contact with the numbers. A dashboard polling at 15 s over 20
   * repos is ~4,800 requests an hour, and each open tab multiplies it; the
   * installation's 5,000/hr budget is the SAME budget the harness spends
   * reviewing pull requests and fixing CI, so a board left open would starve the
   * work it exists to display. That version must not ship.
   *
   * So: ONE GraphQL document per batch of up to ten repos, each an aliased
   * `search(type: ISSUE, query: "repo:o/r is:open is:issue")` block. That is the idiom
   * {@link listRepoDigestDetail} already uses for its three aliased searches —
   * aliases ride one request and one rate-limit point between them. Twenty
   * repos therefore cost TWO requests per refresh, and with the board cache's
   * 120 s TTL in front (`src/admin/board-cache.ts`) the steady state is ~60
   * requests an hour **regardless of how many dashboards are open**.
   *
   * ## Batched by OWNER, because the token is
   *
   * {@link kit} resolves a per-OWNER installation and each installation mints
   * its own token, so a single document can only span repos of one account.
   * The caller groups by owner; this method takes the owner explicitly and
   * treats `repos` as bare names under it.
   *
   * ## `search` is subject to SECONDARY limits, which the point budget does not
   * describe
   *
   * GitHub throttles search independently of the documented points, with no
   * warning in the response headers. A throttle therefore falls back to
   * {@link listRepoActivitySince} (`maxPages: 1`) per repo and marks the result
   * `fallback` + `throttled`: the board degrades to a bounded, slightly
   * lossy view of the repo rather than showing an empty column, and the cache
   * reads `throttled` as its cue to back off that owner.
   *
   * Keyed by the QUALIFIED `owner/repo` so the caller can index one map across
   * every owner it asked about.

   * hand days earlier still appears. Deciding which of them the merge actually
   * closed needs the timestamps, so they are returned unjudged and
