/**
 * The posted review's SUMMARY, written AFTER the attention boundary has decided
 * what posts.
 *
 * The adjudicator used to write `summary` in `findings.json`, before the poster
 * applied the inline and body caps — so it could not know what would be cut,
 * and routinely enumerated findings the boundary then withheld. That summary is
 * the review body GitHub shows, so the withheld claims reached the PR anyway
 * and were graded as posted: on the Martian cal.com arm (2026-09-25) a review
 * the poster capped at 5 inline + 5 body read as 12 findings, the summary
 * listing four numbered defects plus an "Also flagged below:" line naming five
 * more, one of them a finding the boundary had recorded `internal`.
 *
 * So under a boundary the adjudicator's prose is never posted. This module
 * writes the summary from the POSTED set only — the model is handed nothing
 * the boundary withheld, so it cannot mention it — and falls back to a
 * summary rendered in code whenever the model call cannot be trusted to
 * answer (no posted findings, no model, an error, an empty or oversized
 * reply). The fallback is deterministic on purpose: an APPROVE with nothing
 * posted is exactly the shape the duplicate-review guard compares byte for
 * byte, and a model-written body would never repeat.
 *
 * The one piece of the adjudicator's summary that survives is the re-review
 * LEDGER (Fixed / Still open / Pinned by a test / Withdrawn): it reports on
 * findings a previous review already posted, so it cannot leak a withheld one,
 * and the model here has no way to reconstruct it.
