/**
 * The PR state machine — one resolved snapshot per dispatch.
 *
 * Before this module, what the harness "knew" about a pull request was read
 * from six sites (`dependencyDedupSkip`, `handlePrFix`, `dispatchWorkflow`,
 * `review-discovery`, and both dependency cron sweeps), each fetching an
 * overlapping subset and each free to disagree — while the state itself lived
 * across seven stores (GitHub labels, the `last-light/review` check run, run
 * `context`, run `scratch`, execution status, live GitHub reads, and a file in
 * the sandbox workspace). Three shipped-defect-grade bugs fell out of that; see
 * `docs/plans/dependency-pr-resilience/09-state-machine.md`.
 *
 * The fix is structural, not incremental: **resolve the PR's state once, then
 * decide**. `resolvePrState` is the only place that reads it; every policy
 * question is a PURE function over the result (`../engine/pr-decisions.ts`), so
 * the decisions are table-testable against literal fixtures with no GitHub mock
 * and no sandbox.
 *
 * {@link PrState} is therefore the documentation of the state machine: it can be
 * read, reviewed and diffed, which prose across ten documents cannot.

/**
 * Fill the two `spec`-axis fields on an already-resolved snapshot:

 * **A separate, opt-in step rather than part of {@link resolvePrState}**, and
 * the split is the whole design:
 *
 * - It costs three live reads (two GraphQL, one REST) that nothing needed before
 *   WP0, and `resolvePrState` runs on every PR-scoped dispatch on every route.
 *   Folding them in would spend them on `pr-fix` and the dependency crons, which
 *   read neither.
 * - Locked decision 8 says `review.analysis.enabled: false` reproduces today's
 *   review byte-for-byte. The cheapest way to guarantee that is for the inputs
 *   never to be fetched, so the projection has nothing to project and the
 *   template context is unchanged rather than changed-but-empty.
 *
 * Called at the `dispatchWorkflow` choke point, right before `renderContext`, so
 * every route — webhook, cron fan-out, `/api/run`, admin retry — gets the same
 * enrichment or none of it. The webhook route's snapshot arrives here on
 * `_prState` and is enriched in place, which is why this mutates rather than
 * returning a copy: the object is the one persisted on `context.prState`.
 *
 * **Never throws.** Same contract as every read in `resolvePrState`: a failure
 * lands in {@link PrState.readErrors} and leaves the field at the value that
 * cannot cause a wrong claim — `changedFiles: null`, which makes the obligation
 * builder emit nothing rather than a one-ended seed.

 * `succeeded` at this head, so the dedup reads "we already handled this SHA" and
 * the retry becomes a no-op with the budgets sitting freshly armed. A push
 * clears the same guard by changing the SHA; a retry has to say it.
 *
 * **The ask survives the tick it arrived on**, which is the part that is easy to

 * to this dispatch, so a retry recorded on one tick and dispatched on a later
 * one — exactly what `recordIntervention`'s standalone row exists for, and what

 * unrelated reason — was un-assessed on the tick that could not use it and
 * re-assessed on the tick that could. Hence the predicate is "has a run SERVED
 * this ask", not "did this ask arrive just now".
 *
 * A run has served it when the row claiming the head carries the same
 * {@link interventionKey} on its own snapshot: `dispatchWorkflow` persists the
 * resolved snapshot on `context.prState`, so a run dispatched by the retry
 * carries it and a run that finished before the ask does not. That is what
 * bounds the whole clause — one extra window per ask, not a dedup switched off
 * for the life of the pull request — and it is why the `retry-requested` row
 * itself must be kept out of `assessedHeadShaByWorkflow` above: it carries the

 * snapshot — and it is what bounds the whole mechanism: the next escalation
 * writes a fresh `escalatedAtSha` at the same head, the intervention is by then
 * the one the prior run already saw, and the `escalated:` skip binds again. No
 * ping-pong, and no second budget to keep in step (locked decision 9's

 * PROBLEM so far" — and a partial update is how they drift apart. The clearest
 * symptom of deriving them separately: a maintainer's push resets `attempt` to
 * 1 while `{{priorAttempts}}` still narrates attempts 1–3, so the prompt tells
 * the agent it is on attempt 1 and then recounts three of them.
 *
 * So a FRESH PROBLEM clears all three at once. Everything else appends the
 * prior run's rendered line and advances (or does not advance) the counter.
 *
 * ## The one asymmetry: the journal survives a retry
 *
 * Locked decision 8 (03-retry-intervention.md). Two ways to reach a fresh
 * problem, and they are NOT the same fresh problem:
 *
 * |                       | `attempt` | cost baseline | `priorAttempts`        | `flakyDeferrals` | `priorDiagnosisClass` |
 * |-----------------------|-----------|---------------|------------------------|------------------|-----------------------|
 * | push (non-bot head)   | 1         | re-stamped    | **wiped**              | 0                | null                  |
 * | retry                 | 1         | re-stamped    | **carried + seam line**| 0                | null                  |
 *
 * A push changed the code, so prior findings may be stale. A retry changed
 * nothing but patience — and discarding `priorAttempts` there sends attempt 1
 * of the new window straight down attempt 1 of the old window's road. On the
 * PR that produced this plan the journal held the one useful fact: that the
 * diagnosis had already concluded CI was green at the current head.
 *
 * `flakyDeferrals` resets on BOTH. A human intervening is a statement that the
 * flaky-versus-real inference should start over, and they have better evidence
 * than the counter does.
 *
 * The seam line is not decoration. Without it the journal renders `attempt 1`,
 * `attempt 2`, and then a run that also calls itself attempt 1, with nothing
 * saying where the boundary is.

 *    completes. A run that crashed before `diagnose` finished — sandbox
 *    provisioning failure, quota rejection, model API error — harvested no
 *    diagnosis and costs nothing. That rule is the single most important
 *    robustness property in the design: without it, one bad hour silently
 *    escalates EVERY open dependency PR across EVERY managed repo to
 *    `requires-human`, and a human then un-sticks each one by hand.
 *    `fix.maxCostUsd` and `MAX_RESTART_RESUMES` bound the crash-loop case
 *    instead, and neither poisons a label.
 * 2. **Its class is one that costs an attempt** — §S1's class table, encoded as
 *    {@link ATTEMPT_FREE_CLASSES}. `flaky` and `upstream-broken` are correct
 *    stopping verdicts about something other than this PR's code; charging for
 *    them would leave the PR with no attempts left at the moment it becomes
 *    fixable, and would make `fix.maxFlakyDeferrals` unreachable.
 *
 * An UNRECOGNISED class counts. A hallucinated class token is not evidence that
 * the run cost nothing, and the free-attempt direction is the unbounded one.
 *
 * Two fallbacks, in order:
 *
 * - **No PARSED diagnosis** — the ledger decides. Two very different runs land
 *   here and it is deliberate that they are NOT told apart: one has no harvest
 *   namespace at all (it predates the harvest, or died before its first
 *   `onPhaseEnd`), the other harvested and parsed nothing. Reading the second as
 *   "spent nothing" was the defect — `harvestFixMarkers` writes the namespace
 *   unconditionally for the fix family, so a malformed marker produces a
 *   non-null harvest carrying `diagnosis: null`, and treating that as a free run
 *   pinned the PR at attempt 1 for its whole life with `fix.maxCostUsd` as the
 *   only remaining brake.
 *
 *   The probe is `diagnose`'s own ledger row: the phase carries
 *   `on_output.requires_marker: "DIAGNOSIS_COMPLETE:"`, so a SUCCEEDED
 *   `diagnose` cannot exist without a well-formed marker having been emitted.
 *   Same fact, read less directly, and without the class. Failing CLOSED here
 *   costs a crashed run nothing, because a run whose `diagnose` genuinely never
 *   finished has no succeeded row for the probe to find.
 * - **A read error** — fail CLOSED (count it). A read failure must not silently
 *   grant a free attempt forever; the cost cap is the backstop, and the
 *   alternative is an unbounded retry loop.
