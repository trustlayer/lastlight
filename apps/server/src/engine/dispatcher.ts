 * THE dispatch gate — decide, log, and apply the decision's own consequences.
 *
 * Both routes call this one function: the dispatcher for webhook/comment
 * events, and `dispatchWorkflow` for the cron fan-out, `/api/run` and resume.
 * They used to carry two hand-kept-in-step copies of it, reading two different
 * configs (see {@link prPolicyConfig}) and diverging on which side effects a
 * skip earns.
 *
 * The two consequences that belong to the DECISION rather than to the route are
 * applied here, so neither can be forgotten by one caller:
 *
 * - a **deferred review** leaves the placeholder check that says "not yet"
 *   (itself route-limited inside `postReviewCheckForSkip` — a statement about a
 *   head SHA belongs on PR attention, not on every sweep tick);
 * - a skip that is **terminal for this problem** is labelled and explained, and
 *   RECORDS A RUN ROW without which `escalatedAtSha` never persists and the next
 *   dispatch reads our own label as a human's permanent hold (09 → D1).
 *
 * What is NOT applied here is the route's own courtesy: replying to the human
 * whose request was dropped, and the fork-PR notice. Both are answers to a
 * person who is watching, so they belong to the route that has one — a daily
 * cron re-posting a fork notice for the life of the PR is spam, not
 * transparency. The caller keys them on the TYPED fields the deciding branch
 * set (`decision.runInFlight`, `state.isFork`), never on the reason prose.
