 * empty completion) can arrive with no final text at all. Two degenerate shapes
 * hide behind that "success"; catch both so a run with no answer fails instead
 * of passing green with empty output:
 *
 *   - **Cut off mid-tool-call** (`endedOnToolCall`) — Pi hit its internal step
 *     cap right after requesting a tool; `finalText` is a "let me check X"
 *     preamble, not an answer. → `error_truncated` (hard).
 *   - **Empty completion** — a terminal `agent_end`, NOT mid-tool-call, whose
 *     final answer is empty. The context-rot failure: the agent buries itself in
 *     tool output (e.g. giant lockfile file-lists in a dependabot sweep) and its
 *     final turn comes back empty. → `unknown` (soft: a plain phase still fails,
 *     but a loop can retry). This is the generic backstop behind per-workflow
 *     postconditions like `on_output.requires_marker`.
 *
 * Anything with a real answer, a real agent error, or an already-non-success
 * reason passes through untouched.
