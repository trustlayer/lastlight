/**
 * The `spec` obligation family — "does this change do what was asked?".
 *
 * Issue #271's fix 6, and the one axis nothing has tried. All nine "what to
 * check" items in `skills/code-review/SKILL.md` (correctness, contracts, edge
 * cases, security, complexity, duplication, type safety, regression risk, test
 * coverage, fit) are STANDARDS checks, and candidates v1, v2 and v3 all
 * targeted that same axis between them for a total movement of one gold finding
 * (`docs/plans/deterministic-pr-levers.md` §"Evidence base").
 *
 * ## The rule that shapes every line below
 *
 * > **A seed naming one end of a defect mechanism is worse than no seed.**
 *
 * IRIS's ablation, in numbers: CodeQL sources + LLM sinks = +9 over CodeQL
 * alone; **LLM sources + CodeQL sinks = −3, actively worse than seeding
 * nothing**; both ends = +28. So an obligation here names both ends or it is
 * not emitted:
 *
 * | End | Where it comes from |
 * |---|---|
 * | **what was asked** | a criterion quoted VERBATIM out of the linked issue or the PR body |
 * | **where it could live** | {@link SpecObligation.candidates} — the PR's own changed files, with `found: false` |
 *
 * The second end is mechanical on purpose. *"The issue asks for rate limiting —
 * check that"* is the one-ended shape, and it will not merely under-perform: it
 * will degrade the arm and be read as evidence that the spec axis does not work
 * (§D7's "risk to respect"). The changed-file list is the same set
 * `git diff --name-only origin/<base>...HEAD` yields, and `found: false` is the
 * literal claim we are entitled to make — we have looked nowhere.
 *
 * ## And the rule that shapes the QUESTION
 *
 * v3's lesson 1: seeding works only at **question granularity**. *"Check this
 * area"* earns an honest CLEAN, because an obligation one abstraction level too
 * high gets discharged AT THAT LEVEL and the defect lives below it. *"Quote the
 * line that enforces THIS constant"* produced the only gold match the whole
 * investigation has. So {@link SpecObligation.question} is always answerable by
 * quoting one line, or by stating that no such line exists.
 *
 * ## Purity
 *
 * Everything here is a pure transform over strings the harness already read, so
 * the extraction rules are exercised directly in `review-spec.test.ts` rather
 * than through a GitHub mock. The impure half — actually reading the linked
 * issues and the changed-file list — is `resolveSpecContext` in
 * `./pr-state.ts`, and the projection into the prompt is `renderContext` in
 * `./pr-decisions.ts`.

 * The discharge contract, and it is `renderFamilyBlock`'s VERBATIM in every part

 * questions differ per family, *the rule for answering one must not*, "or a
 * family becomes cheaper to discharge than its neighbour and the funnel stops
 * being comparable". This family had drifted on every clause of that rule at
 * once — a different code set, no row shape at all, no id checklist, no
 * exemplar — so `spec` was not a sixth family running the same contract, it was
 * a second contract wearing the same word.
 *
 * ── The four codes, and the fifth one that is gone ──────────────────────────
 *
 * This block used to offer **`N/A`** — "the criterion is not about code in this
 * PR" — in place of `PROBE`. Both halves of that swap were wrong:
 *
 *   - `N/A` is not one of `DISCHARGE_CODES` (`packages/code-facts/src/discharge.ts`),
 *     so the moment `spec` is graded by the same gate as its five siblings every
 *     `N/A` row lands `bad-code` and the branch burns every iteration it has
 *     against a gate it cannot satisfy. That is WP3's `$LL_FAMILY` bug rebuilt
 *     out of vocabulary instead of shell.
 *   - `PROBE` was missing, and it is the code this family needs MOST. "The
 *     endpoint returns 429 once the caller exceeds ten requests" is an
 *     acceptance criterion that cannot be settled by reading and can be settled
 *     by running — which is precisely what WP4's `falsify` phase exists for. A
 *     spec pass could not ask for one.
 *
 * The out-of-scope case the fifth code served is real and it keeps an answer:
 * `ABSENT` is *factually* what it is — no changed file implements it — written
 * with `consequence: null` and `failureScenario: null`, and the reason in
 * `claim`. The code records WHAT WAS FOUND; the evidence record says how much
 * it matters, and `deriveVerdict` computes the rest. That is the same division of
 * labour the five siblings already run on ("A clean QUOTE gets a row too").

 *
 * ── What this family legitimately does differently, and what it does not ────
 *
 * It is the sixth branch of a six-branch survey and everything about *how a
 * question is answered* is now `renderFamilyBlock`'s, verbatim where it can be:
 * the four codes, the prescribed row and its field names, `failureScenario`
 * REQUIRED but `null` on a clean QUOTE, the un-truncated id checklist, one
 * worked exemplar, the id namespacing, and the hard limits. Three things stay
 * different **because the inputs are**:
 *
 *   1. The obligations come from the PR body and the linked issues, not from
 *      `facts.json` — so an obligation carries a `criterion` + `source` rather
 *      than a `mechanism` + `introducedAt`, and there is no `expects:` line
 *      (nothing predicts whether a criterion is quote- or probe-answerable).
 *   2. They are built harness-side and never reach `obligations.json`, so there
 *      is no `lastlight-facts discharge --ledger` to point at. The block says
 *      that in those words — otherwise the missing pointer reads as an
 *      oversight — and the id list below IS the checklist.
 *   3. It is delivered as `{{specObligations}}` template context rather than a
 *      `context_file`, because there is no file on disk to attach. That is why
 *      nothing in this block may contain `{{` or `}}`: unlike its five siblings
 *      it goes through `renderTemplate`, whose leftover-marker guard would flag
 *      them.
 *
 * Returns `""` when there is nothing to say AND nothing degraded, so the caller
 * can omit the key entirely; a degraded set still renders, because
 * "we could not look" and "we looked and it is fine" are different facts
 * (locked decision 6). This is the one place `renderFamilyBlock`'s never-empty
 * rule is not copied, and the reason is that its purpose is served elsewhere: a
 * family block's ABSENCE is ambiguous because it is a FILE, while this key's
 * absence fires `survey-spec.md`'s own fallback. **It is also unreachable from
 * {@link buildSpecObligations}**, which pushes a `degraded[]` reason on every
 * path that returns no obligation.
 *
 * ── `contract` — the sixth axis moves with the five ─────────────────────────
 *
 * `review.analysis.obligationContract`, the control for 2026-08-23's result
 * (recall 4-of-5 → 0-of-5 while compliance went 0/33 → 33/33, two variables at
 * once). Its argument, its measurement and the five siblings' implementation are
 * in `packages/code-facts/src/seed-render.ts`; this parameter is the same switch
 * so that the arm changes six blocks and not five. Under `minimal` this block
 * drops the pointer at the row's `discharge` field, the `discharge` and
 * `failureScenario` fields themselves, the un-truncated id checklist (and the
 * note explaining why there is no `--ledger` for it), the worked exemplar and
 * the `ROW_RULES` that only exist to govern those two fields. Nothing else
 * moves — see {@link SPEC_DISCHARGE_MINIMAL} for why this is not a revert of
 * this file to its own pre-2026-08-23 text.
 *
 * The default is `full`, so every existing caller — including every test that
 * passes one argument — renders exactly what it rendered before.
