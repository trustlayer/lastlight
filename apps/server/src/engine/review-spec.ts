/**
 * The `spec` obligation family — "does this change do what was asked?".
 *
 * Issue #271's fix 6, and the one axis nothing has tried. All nine "what to
 * check" items in `skills/code-review/SKILL.md` (correctness, contracts, edge
 * cases, security, complexity, duplication, type safety, regression risk, test
 * coverage, fit) are STANDARDS checks, and candidates v1, v2 and v3 all
 * targeted that same axis between them for a total movement of one gold finding
 * (`docs/plans/deterministic-pr-levers.md` §"Evidence base").
 *
 * ## The rule that shapes every line below
 *
 * > **A seed naming one end of a defect mechanism is worse than no seed.**
 *
 * IRIS's ablation, in numbers: CodeQL sources + LLM sinks = +9 over CodeQL
 * alone; **LLM sources + CodeQL sinks = −3, actively worse than seeding
 * nothing**; both ends = +28. So an obligation here names both ends or it is
 * not emitted:
 *
 * | End | Where it comes from |
 * |---|---|
 * | **what was asked** | a criterion quoted VERBATIM out of the linked issue or the PR body |
 * | **where it could live** | {@link SpecObligation.candidates} — the PR's own changed files, with `found: false` |
 *
 * The second end is mechanical on purpose. *"The issue asks for rate limiting —
 * check that"* is the one-ended shape, and it will not merely under-perform: it
 * will degrade the arm and be read as evidence that the spec axis does not work
 * (§D7's "risk to respect"). The changed-file list is the same set
 * `git diff --name-only origin/<base>...HEAD` yields, and `found: false` is the
 * literal claim we are entitled to make — we have looked nowhere.
 *
 * ## And the rule that shapes the QUESTION
 *
 * v3's lesson 1: seeding works only at **question granularity**. *"Check this
 * area"* earns an honest CLEAN, because an obligation one abstraction level too
 * high gets discharged AT THAT LEVEL and the defect lives below it. *"Quote the
 * line that enforces THIS constant"* produced the only gold match the whole
 * investigation has. So {@link SpecObligation.question} is always answerable by
 * quoting one line, or by stating that no such line exists.
 *
 * ## Purity
 *
 * Everything here is a pure transform over strings the harness already read, so
 * the extraction rules are exercised directly in `review-spec.test.ts` rather
 * than through a GitHub mock. The impure half — actually reading the linked
 * issues and the changed-file list — is `resolveSpecContext` in
 * `./pr-state.ts`, and the projection onto the run context (as one line of
 * JSON the `units` phase cuts into units) is `renderContext` in
 * `./pr-decisions.ts`.
