 * reason is written `"<case>: <explanation>"` so the case stays greppable
 * without a parallel enum to keep in sync.
 *
 * `inputs` is the subset of the snapshot the decision actually read. It exists
 * so the detail panel can show WHY without the view re-deriving anything, and
 * so a table test asserts the decision and its justification together.
 *
 * Purity is the point: 09-state-machine.md observes that most verification of
 * this plan becomes a table test over literal `PrState` fixtures — no GitHub

 * A skip that must be ESCALATED on the pull request — labelled `requires-human`
 * and explained in one comment — rather than being dropped silently.
 *
 * Three of `resolveFixDisposition`'s skips are terminal *for this problem*: no
 * further event will change the answer until a human (or a new commit) does
 * something. 04-retry.md §4.3 requires those to be visible, because a PR that is
 * skipped with no label, no comment and nothing on the PR explaining why is
 * strictly WORSE than `requires-human` — it is dead and undiagnosable.
 *
 * The other skips must NOT escalate, and the distinction is structural rather
 * than editorial:
 *
 * - `upstream-broken` is not this PR's fault and self-heals the moment the base
 *   goes green (09 → D1 is explicit: skip without labelling).
 * - `fork-pr` gets its own explanation — nothing is wrong with the change.
 * - `on-hold` is a maintainer's instruction; labelling and commenting on a PR
 *   somebody has explicitly told us to leave alone is the opposite of obeying it.
 * - `escalated` is ALREADY escalated; re-applying would comment on every
 *   subsequent event.
 * - `already-assessed` is a duplicate delivery, not a verdict.
 *
 * The case is produced by the branch that decided, and travels on the
 * {@link Decision} beside the reason — so the applier switches on a typed field
 * rather than string-matching the reason prose. Every other consequence follows
 * the same rule: {@link Decision.runInFlight}, {@link Decision.readDegraded} and

  //   suppressed by a review that does not exist.

  //   whenever the read was degraded or truncated, and `allPathsGenerated`
  //   answers `false` for `null` and for an empty pattern list — so every
  //   uncertain case dispatches.
  //
  // `skip`, not `defer`: there is no future event that turns this same delta
  // into a review, which is exactly the distinction the two decisions carry.

  // `lastBotReview` is checked here rather than assumed from a non-null delta:

/**
 * "We have already reviewed this head SHA" — asked the SECOND time, after the

 *
 * One fact, two questions, and conflating them is the bug this exists to stop.
 * {@link resolveReviewTrigger} asks *may we spend a run*, where a prior review
 * is DEDUP and an explicit request overrides it. This asks *may we publish the
 * review we have already paid for*, where the same prior review is not dedup at
 * all: `post-review` re-executes on every resume and every retry — it is a
 * handler phase, so it writes no `executions` row and `shouldRunPhase` never
 * skips it — and without a guard a boot-time resume posts a second copy of what
 * the first pass already published.
 *
 * The two are distinguishable, and the discriminator costs nothing: the review
 * the DISPATCH SNAPSHOT saw. One that is still the review
 * `resolveReviewTrigger` was asked to override is a PRIOR review — post over
 * it, because a maintainer asked for exactly that. One that appeared since is
 * OURS, posted minutes ago by this very run — never post over that, whoever
 * asked. Read off GitHub rather than off a marker we write on the way past, so
 * it still holds when the run died between the POST and its own bookkeeping,
 * which is precisely when a resume happens.
 *
 * cliftonc/drizzle-cube#937 is the case: an `@last-light review` on a head we
 * had already reviewed surveyed, adjudicated and reconciled for eight minutes,
 * reported `succeeded`, and posted nothing — the gate had correctly decided
 * `requested: an explicit review request overrides mode, draft and dedup`, and
 * this step then re-decided it in the other direction.
 *
 * `explicitRequest` here is the SAME value the gate was given: a discrete human
 * act (an `@bot review` comment, a review request by name, `lastlight review`).
 * Note what it deliberately is NOT — the `review.requestLabel`. A label is a
 * standing state rather than an act: it is still there on the next push and the
 * next 30-minute sweep, each of which the trigger gate dispatches, so honouring
 * it here would post a fresh review of an unchanged head every half hour until
 * somebody took the label off. The same distinction {@link
 * Decision.selfAuthoredPr} draws for its one-comment-per-ask notice.
