/**
 * Escalation — what a terminal skip DOES to the pull request.
 *
 * `resolveFixDisposition` decides; this applies. Three of its skips are
 * terminal for the current problem (see `EscalationCase`), and before this
 * module all three were silent: the dispatch returned `{ kind: "skipped" }`
 * with a reason in the server log and *nothing at all* on the PR. 04-retry.md
 * §4.3 calls that strictly worse than being visible — a maintainer looking at a
 * red dependency PR that the bot has quietly abandoned has no way to learn that
 * it was abandoned, let alone why.
 *
 * So an escalating skip does three things, in this order:
 *
 *   1. **records a run row**  (why it must, below)
 *   2. **applies `requires-human`**
 *   3. **posts ONE comment** naming the case, the attempt count and each
 *      attempt's `class=` / `cause=`.
 *
 * ## Why the row, and why FIRST
 *
 * This is the crux, and it is not an implementation detail — it is 09 → D1's
 * general rule: *no prior-run verdict may gate dispatch unless the skipping
 * path writes a run row.*
 *
 * `escalatedAtSha` is read by `applyDerivedState` off the PRIOR RUN'S persisted
 * `context.prState`, via `latestForTrigger`. A dispatch-time skip returns
 * `{ kind: "skipped" }` and writes no row. So an escalation that stayed a
 * row-less skip would never persist `escalatedAtSha`, the guard would never
 * bind, and every subsequent event on the same dead PR would escalate again —
 * re-applying the label and posting the comment once per event, which is the
 * one behaviour worse than the silent skip this module replaced.
 *
 * That is also why the row is written BEFORE the label. Every ordering has a
 * crash window; this one chooses the harmless side of it. Row-then-crash leaves
 * an escalation record with no label — the guard still binds off the record, so
 * the PR is quiet and the label lands on the next escalation.
 * Label-then-crash would leave a label with no record: a `requires-human` on the
 * PR that nothing in the code can see, so the next event escalates and comments
 * all over again.
 *
 * The row is recorded **`succeeded`**, not `failed`: 09 → S1 reserves `failed`
 * for MALFUNCTION, and correct-but-stopped outcomes record `succeeded`. The run
 * did its job — it correctly determined the PR cannot be fixed here. `failed`
 * would post `messages.on_failure` on the PR, offer a dashboard Retry that
 * cannot succeed, and pollute the cost/failure stats.
 *
 * ## Once, and only once
 *
 * Neither `postComment` nor `addLabels` de-duplicates, and no API scan is used
 * to ask "did we already comment". The once-only property comes from the
 * persisted record instead: the next dispatch at the same head reads
 * `escalatedAtSha` back and takes the `escalated:` skip — which carries no
 * `EscalationCase`, so nothing is applied.
 * A maintainer's push makes it a fresh problem, the guard falls away, and the
 * PR is dispatchable again with no label to remove by hand.
 *
 * That property is therefore **entirely dependent on the `escalated:` guard
 * firing first**, and the guard is bypassable: an explicit `@bot` request skips
 * it by design, and a recorded retry consumes the record outright
 * (03-retry-intervention.md). Every bypass lands back here, so `escalatePr`
 * additionally refuses outright when it has already escalated at this exact
 * head. Re-recording would be harmless; re-commenting is #256.

 * Persist a retry that produced **no run**, so it is not silently lost.
 *
 * ## Where the record normally lives — and why this is the exception
 *
 * A retry that is immediately followed by a dispatch needs no row of its own:
 * `dispatchWorkflow` persists the whole resolved snapshot on the run's
 * `context.prState`, so the dispatched run itself carries the intervention and
 * the next dispatch reads it back exactly as it reads `escalatedAtSha`. That is
 * the common path and it is free.
 *
 * The exception is a retry the gate then skips for an unrelated reason — most
 * usefully `upstream-broken`, where the base branch is red at the moment the
 * maintainer asks. A skip returns `{ kind: "skipped" }` and writes NO row (09 →
 * D1), so without this the ask evaporates: the base goes green an hour later,
 * the PR is picked up, and the budget is still exhausted, so it escalates again
 * and the maintainer's retry never happened.
 *
 * Same shape and same ordering as {@link escalatePr} — the record first, before
 * any GitHub write — even though the crash window here is gentler (worst case a
 * retry is lost and the maintainer asks again). Two mechanisms with the same
 * shape and different orderings is how the next reader gets it wrong. There is
 * no GitHub write at all today; the ordering is stated so that adding one later
 * cannot get it backwards.
 *
 * ## The seam the admin API and the CLI use
 *
 * `lastlight pr retry <owner/repo#N>` is a thin client over an admin endpoint,
 * and the endpoint is exactly this pair of calls:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const state = await resolvePrState(owner, repo, prNumber, {
 *   github, db, botLogin,
 *   intervention: { via: "api", by: session.login, note: reason },
 * });
 * const outcome = await recordIntervention(workflowName, state, { db, github });
 * ```
 *
 * `resolvePrState` stamps `at`/`atSha` and re-arms the snapshot; this persists
 * it. The route may then dispatch immediately (in which case this row is
 * redundant but harmless — the guard below makes the pair idempotent) or leave
 * the next cron tick to pick the PR up.
 *
 * Never throws.
