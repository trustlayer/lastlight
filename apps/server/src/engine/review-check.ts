/**
 * The `last-light/review` Check Run — as a **projection of run state**.
 *
 * Before this module the check was created in `dispatcher.ts` and completed
 * inside a `.then()` chained onto the in-memory workflow promise, and
 * `updateCheckRun` appeared nowhere else. `resume.ts` and `admission.ts` never
 * touched it, and the queued branch said so out loud: *"Documented limitation:
 * the check stays in-progress until admission fires."* So a check stranded
 * `in_progress` on every server restart mid-review (i.e. **every deploy**),
 * every queued-then-resumed run, every `expireStaleRuns` cancellation and every
 * crash. Nobody noticed because `check-prs-awaiting-review` re-reviewed the PR
 * within 30 minutes and `createCheckRun` posted a *new* check under the same
 * name, superseding the stranded one — the polling cron was the de facto repair
 * mechanism for stuck checks. That repair is accidental, and the per-SHA review
 * dedup breaks it: a check strands most often on a review that ran and posted,
 * and in that state `botReviewAtHead` is set, so the dedup skips the run and
 * posts no superseding check. You can have the dedup or the accidental repair,
 * not both.
 *
 * The bug is not routing, it is that **the check's state lived somewhere the
 * run's state did not** (09-state-machine.md → S2, locked decision 16). So:
 *
 * 1. The check id (+ owner, repo, head SHA) is persisted on the run row the
 *    moment the run exists — {@link recordReviewCheck}.
 * 2. It is completed from the run's TERMINAL TRANSITION — the same place that
 *    writes `succeeded` / `failed` / `cancelled` — via the store's
 *    `TerminalRunObserver`. `simple.ts`, `resume.ts`, `expireQueued` and the
 *    admin cancel therefore all resolve it for free, and a future terminal path
 *    cannot forget to.
 * 3. A run that never dispatches creates no check at all, rather than creating
 *    one and immediately concluding it.
 *
 * Boot-time reconciliation is deliberately NOT needed: terminal-transition
 * completion plus the existing `MAX_RESTART_RESUMES` resume path covers
 * restart.
 *
 * The one thing that is NOT a run — the `queued` / `neutral` PLACEHOLDER a
 * deferred review leaves behind ({@link postPlaceholderReviewCheck}) — is
 * terminal by construction: `neutral` is already concluded, and a `queued`
 * check is superseded by the real one the moment a review dispatches (GitHub
 * shows the latest run for a check name), with the 30-minute sweep as the
 * backstop that guarantees one arrives.
