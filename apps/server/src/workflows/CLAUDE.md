# Workflow runner

This is where the harness actually executes agent work. Everything that runs
more than one agent call — build cycles, triage scans, health reports, PR
reviews — goes through here. The design goal is that adding a new workflow
should require **only a YAML file** in `workflows/`, no runner changes.

## Files

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `schema.ts` | Zod schema for `AgentWorkflowDefinition`, `PhaseDefinition`, `PhaseLoop`, `GenericLoop`, `CronWorkflowDefinition`. Source of truth for what a YAML file is allowed to contain. Also home to the optional top-level `classification:` block (`intent`/`description`/`examples`) — how a workflow contributes its category to the composed intent classifier and claims a routable intent (issue #164) — its chat-facing counterpart `chat:` (`trigger`/`summary`/`deflect`/`reply`), which is how a workflow advertises itself in the composed chat system prompt (`src/engine/chat/chat-prompt.ts`; an explicit opt-in, NOT derived from `classification` — see the schema doc for the three workflows where the two diverge), plus `RESERVED_CONTROL_INTENTS` + `intentToken()`, the top-level `pr_scoped:` flag (see `pr-scope.ts`), and the five runtime-policy keys `git_access` / `workspace` / `prepopulate_synth_branch` / `prepopulate_pr_head_ref` / `pr_fix_shaped` (see `target-policy.ts`). |
| `loader.ts` | Reads `workflows/*.yaml`, validates against the schema, caches parsed definitions. `getWorkflow(name)` is the only lookup the rest of the code uses. |
| `templates.ts` | Mustache-ish template engine. Handles `{{branch}}`, `{{issueDir}}`, `{{contextSnapshot}}`, `{{models.architect}}`, `{{phaseOutputs.guardrails.output}}`, list iteration, and `unless_*` clauses. |
| `simple.ts` | Top-of-stack entry: `runSimpleWorkflow(workflowName, request, …)`. Picks the trigger id, builds the template context, creates or reuses a `workflow_runs` row, then calls `runWorkflow`. |
| `runner.ts` | The **scheduler**. One sequential walk over a chain-synthesized DAG — no separate linear/DAG paths. Owns the `phases[]`/`outputs{}` accumulation, node status, cancel/skip handling, and the terminal `set_phase`/PR wrap-up. Delegates each node's body to `PhaseExecutor`. Also: `gitAccessProfileForWorkflow` (a lookup over each workflow's own `git_access` key — see `target-policy.ts`), `gitSandboxAccessForWorkflow`. Re-exports `isTerminated`. |
| `phase-executor.ts` | `PhaseExecutor` — owns every per-phase body (context / standard agent / reviewer-loop / generic-loop, plus approval & reply gates) behind `execute(node, outputs) → PhaseOutcome`. Constructed once per run from three collaborators: run-scoped data, a `PhaseReporter`, a `PhaseResolver`. Also home to `runPhase`, `buildPhasePrompt`, `phaseConfigFor`, `isTerminated`. Unit-tested with fakes (`phase-executor.test.ts`). |
| `dag.ts` | Pure graph logic: `buildDag(phases, { chainIfNoDeps })`, `evaluateTriggerRule`, `getReadyNodes`, `getNodesToSkip`, `isComplete`, `topoSort`. No IO. `chainIfNoDeps` synthesizes a previous-phase chain when no phase declares `depends_on`. |
| `target-policy.ts` | The other five per-workflow runtime facts, derived the same way and memoised on the same asset version: `git_access` (the token profile a run is minted), `workspace` (`per-run` / `per-target-reuse` / `per-target-recreate`), `prepopulate_synth_branch`, `prepopulate_pr_head_ref`, `pr_fix_shaped`. Each was a hardcoded name table until issue #368, so an overlay-only workflow silently got a `read` token and no head-ref pinning. Hard cutover, no legacy floor — `validateAssets` warns instead when a *routed* workflow declares none of the five. |
| `pr-scope.ts` | Which workflows are PR-SCOPED, derived from each definition's `pr_scoped: true` and memoised on the loader's asset version. The span of the PR run lock, the per-head-SHA dedup, escalation and the `PrState` snapshot. Metadata rather than a hardcoded name set because the handlers are operator-configurable through `routes.github.*` — remapping a route to a fork used to drop the whole gate silently (issue #256). The four original built-ins are honoured without the key, with a warning. |
| `phase-ref.ts` | `PhaseRef` value object — the single authority for building loop-iteration labels (`format()`) and parsing them back (`parse()` → base + kind). No IO. |
| `verdict.ts` | `parseReviewerVerdict(output) → { verdict, viaFallback }` — the one pure parser for a reviewer phase's `VERDICT:` marker (with the fallback heuristic). Both runner verdict sites call it. |
| `loop-eval.ts` | Expression evaluator for `generic_loop.until` conditions (`output.contains('PASS')`, `verdict == 'APPROVED'`). |
| `resume.ts` | Startup orphan recovery + approval-gate resume entry point. Called both on harness boot (recover `running` / `paused` runs) and when a user responds to an approval gate. |

## Call graph

```
EventEnvelope

    → src/workflows/simple.ts
      → runSimpleWorkflow()
        → loader.getWorkflow(name)   loads + validates YAML
        → db.createWorkflowRun()     or reuses an existing paused/running row
        → runWorkflow()              [src/workflows/runner.ts] — the scheduler

```

Approval-gate resumption bypasses the router and re-enters via
`src/workflows/resume.ts → resumeOrphanedWorkflows → runWorkflow` (boot
recovery) or `runSimpleWorkflow` (a fresh trigger on a paused/running run).
Resume is **ledger-driven**: the runner always re-runs from the top and the
`executions` table (via `shouldRunPhase`) skips already-completed phases — no
per-workflow branching, no `currentPhase`-derived resume index.

**Retry a failed run.** The dashboard's Retry button (and `lastlight workflow
retry <id>`) reuses the exact same ledger-driven machinery via
`config.retryWorkflow` (`src/index.ts`) → `WorkflowRunStore.restartRun` (flips
`failed → running`, clears `finished_at`/`context.error`, compare-and-set so a
double-click no-ops) → `resumeSimpleRun`. The failed phase's ledger row is
`success=0`, so `shouldRunPhase` re-runs it while already-succeeded phases skip —
resuming from the phase that failed with the same context, taskId and workspace.
Unlike the approval `resumeWorkflow` path (which rebuilds a lossy
owner/repo/issueNumber context), retry reconstructs the full context from the
stored `workflow_runs.context` + `scratch`, so it also retries Slack-thread-scoped
runs (e.g. an `explore` started from Slack).

> because its ledger row is already `success=1` contributes **nothing** to the

## Phase types

A phase is one entry in the `phases:` array of a workflow YAML.

```yaml
phases:
  - name: phase_0
    label: Context
    type: context          # no agent run; just marks a checkpoint for the dashboard

  - name: guardrails
    label: Guardrails
    prompt: prompts/guardrails.md    # renders this template, runs an agent
    model: "{{models.guardrails}}"
    variant: "{{variants.guardrails}}"  # reasoning-effort, e.g. minimal/high
    on_output:
      contains_BLOCKED:
        action: fail
        unless_label: "lastlight:bootstrap"
      contains_READY:
        action: continue

  - name: guardrails_gate          # harness-run full suite: no LLM, verdict = exit code
    type: bash
    timeout_seconds: { from: gate.phaseTimeoutSeconds }
    command: |                     # runs .git/lastlight-gate.sh under timeout {{gate.timeoutSeconds}},
      ...                          # prints READY / BLOCKED — on_output applies to bash phases too
    on_output:
      contains_BLOCKED: { action: fail, unless_label: "lastlight:bootstrap" }

  - name: reviewer
    label: Reviewer
    prompt: prompts/reviewer.md
    model: "{{models.reviewer}}"
    variant: "{{variants.reviewer}}"
    approval_gate: post_reviewer     # pause before moving on
    loop:                             # iterate on REQUEST_CHANGES
      max_cycles: 3
      on_request_changes:
        fix_prompt: prompts/executor.md
        fix_model: "{{models.fix}}"
        fix_variant: "{{variants.fix}}"
        re_review_prompt: prompts/reviewer-rereview.md
```

`model:` resolves through `LASTLIGHT_MODELS` (or the `default` fallback);
`variant:` resolves through `LASTLIGHT_THINKINGS` (or `LASTLIGHT_THINKING`).
Both are optional — omit the YAML entry and the runner uses the env-level
default, omit env-level too and agentic-pi picks its built-in default
(model: `LASTLIGHT_MODEL`, variant: no `--thinking`/`--variant` flag passed).
(The legacy `OPENCODE_*` env names are still accepted as aliases.)

Phase kinds the runner recognises:

- **context** (`type: context`) — no agent execution. Runner persists a
  phase-history entry and moves on. Used for `Context` / `complete` markers
  so the dashboard pipeline shows a checkpoint.
- **agent** (`type: agent`, default) — runs one agent session via
  `executeAgent`. The phase supplies a user prompt via `prompt:` and/or
  a skill catalogue via `skill:`/`skills:`. They can be set
  independently, together, or both:
  - `prompt: prompts/architect.md` renders a template file and passes
    the result as the user prompt.
  - `skills: [pr-review, issue-triage]` (or sugar `skill: pr-review`
    for a single skill) makes each named `skills/<name>/` directory
    available to the agent. Phase setup stages each one into a
    **per-phase bundle** at
    `<workspaceRoot>/.lastlight-skills/<phaseName>/<name>/` (symlink in
    gondolin/none, copy in docker) before the run, then maps the bundle
    to the agent explicitly via pi's `--skill`/`skillPaths` (absolute
    paths, so cwd is irrelevant). The bundle lives at the **workspace
    root** — a sibling of any checked-out repo, never inside its git tree
    (so the agent never sees or commits it) — and is keyed per phase so
    two phases sharing a workspace (sequential today, parallel via
    worktrees later) can't clobber each other's catalogue. pi surfaces
    the mapped skills in the system prompt as an
    XML `<available_skills>` catalogue; the agent reads each SKILL.md via
    its `read` tool on demand — pi.dev's progressive-disclosure model.
    Whole skill *directories* travel along, so any `scripts/` /
    `references/` / `assets/` next to a SKILL.md come too.
  - **When both are set** — the prompt template is the user prompt
    (skill content is *not* auto-embedded), and the staged catalogue
    is available alongside. The template can reference skills by name
    ("see the `pr-review` skill for the structured-feedback format")
    and the agent reads them on demand.
  - **When only skills are set** — the runner emits a short
    auto-generated user prompt nudging the agent to start by reading
    the primary (first-listed) skill's SKILL.md.
  - Phases with neither (`type: context`) get no skill bundle staged at
    all.

  > harvests them rather than orphaned at the workspace root.
- **bash** (`type: bash`) — runs a deterministic shell command
  (`command:`) **inside the sandbox container** (no LLM). Built on
  `DockerSandbox.runCommand` (the non-agent sibling of `runAgent`:
  `docker exec --user agent -w <cwd> … sh -c <cmd>`), running in the same
  workspace agent phases use (the host `workDir` persists across phases by
  taskId). Exit 0 = success; a non-zero exit **fails the phase** and cascades
  like any phase failure. The command is rendered through the template engine
  first (so it can reference `{{phaseOutputs.*}}`, `{{branch}}`, …), then a
  post-render `validateShellCommand` guard rejects any leftover `{{` marker.
  stdout is exposed downstream exactly like an agent phase
  (`output_var` → `{{phaseOutputs.<name>}}`); upstream string outputs
  are also forwarded as `LL_OUT_<PHASE>` env vars (single-line, ≤4KB).
  Honours `unrestricted_egress` / `sandbox_image` / `timeout_seconds` and
  `on_output` (`contains_BLOCKED` with its `unless_*` bypass, and
  `requires_marker`) exactly like an agent phase — build's `guardrails_gate`
  exits 0 and prints its READY/BLOCKED verdict for this. With no
  `timeout_seconds` it uses `sandbox.commandTimeoutSeconds` from resolved config. The run
  is mirrored to a session jsonl (command → `bash` tool_use, output →
  tool_result) so it shows in the dashboard + `lastlight session log` like an
  agent turn, with `turns: 0` and no model cost. On gondolin/none the command
  falls back to a host `spawnSync` in the workspace.
- **script** (`type: script`) — same machinery as `bash`, but runs an inline
  program (`script:`) with a runtime selected by `runtime:` — `js`/`ts` →
  `node` (TS via `--experimental-strip-types`), `python` → `uv run`. The source
  is written to a workspace-root sibling beside the skill bundle (`.lastlight-scripts/<phase>/script.<ext>`,
  never inside the repo git tree) and executed there. Python sources may carry
  a PEP 723 `# /// script` inline-dependency block — `uv run` resolves it from
  PyPI (already on the strict egress allowlist) into a cached venv
  (`UV_CACHE_DIR=/cache/uv`, `UV_PYTHON_DOWNLOADS=never` so it uses the baked-in
  python3).
- **fanout** (`type: fanout`) — N agent sessions run **concurrently
  inside ONE provisioned workspace**, declared as `branches:`. Handler:
  `handlers/fanout.ts`, registered on `EnginePorts.handlers` in
  `runner.ts` — the same seam `post-review` uses, so the engine core
  stays generic. Each branch inherits the phase's
  `prompt`/`skills`/`model`/`variant` and may override them, gets its own
  skill bundle, and gets its own `executions` row under
  `<phase>_branch_<name>` — which is what preserves resume, dedup,
  per-branch cost and the dashboard's longest-prefix grouping.
  `max_concurrent` is clamped by a backend ceiling (`none`/`docker` 6;
  `gondolin`/`smol`/`kubernetes` **1**, because each branch would be a
  micro-VM in the harness process). A ceiling of 1 runs them as a chain,
  byte-identical to declaring sequential phases. Branch `until_bash`
  gates run **after** the join and **sequentially** —
  `InProcessSandbox.runCommand` is a `spawnSync` that blocks the event
  loop, so interleaving would serialise the whole fan-out on the one
  backend it exists to speed up. They are observational unless the phase
  declares `on_branch_gate_failure: { retries: 1 }` (the `pr-review`
  survey does): then a branch whose gate ran and said no is re-run once
  (`_regate` row) with the gate's output appended to its prompt, and
  gated again. No `approval_gate` (a fan-out cannot
  pause mid-flight) and no `loop:`/`generic_loop:` (the branches are the
  iteration shape). Isolation is by **disjoint output paths**, not
  separate checkouts. A branch may also declare **`context_file`** — a
  path relative to the AGENT'S CWD whose contents the harness reads and
  appends to that branch's prompt, so the model resolves no path at all
  (measured: 27 of 133 obligation reads across three stored `pr-review`
  runs resolved against the workspace root instead of the checkout and
  hit ENOENT). It resolves against `ProvisionResult.hostAgentCwd` — the
  host end of the `cwd` a `type: bash` phase runs in — and an unreadable
  path appends a loud NOT AVAILABLE notice rather than nothing. See
  `spec/06-workflow-engine.md` → "`fanout`".
- **loop-phase** — any phase with `loop:` set. Always executes as an
  agent phase internally, but repeated in `reviewer → fix → reviewer`
  pairs up to `max_cycles`. See loop iteration naming below.

`type: bash`/`type: script` phases share the agent phase's dedup ledger
(`runCommandPhase` → `runPhaseLedger`), so they get an `executions` row and
dedup on resume like everything else.

`generic_loop` is a second, newer loop mechanism with an `until`
expression (evaluated by `loop-eval.ts`) instead of fixed review/fix
cycles. Used for custom "retry until X" phases. Its `until_bash` exit-condition
runs **inside the sandbox** (via `executeCommand`, `writeSession: false`)
against the persisted workspace — exit 0 ends the loop. (It used to run on the
harness host via `execSync`; it now executes in the same container the phase
does.)

**`until` short-circuits `until_bash`.** A loop may declare both; `until` is
evaluated first and a match skips the command entirely. That pairing is how the
fix family stops paying for a gate that has nothing left to gate: both fix
workflows carry `until: "output.contains('outcome=pushed tried=')"` alongside
the `.git/lastlight-verify.sh` gate, so once the agent's `CI_FIX_COMPLETE`
marker says it pushed, the harness does **not** spin up a fresh container to
re-run a slower copy of the CI suite GitHub is already running on that commit.
It fires on `pushed` only — `no-change` / `gave-up` pushed nothing, so no
external check exists, the local gate is the only evidence there is, and its red
verdict is what earns the agent the next iteration (short-circuiting those too
would make `fix.localIterations` dead config). `tried=` is in the needle because
`renderAttemptLine` writes a replayed `{{priorAttempts}}` line *without* it, so
a quoted journal line from an earlier attempt can't trip the short-circuit —
`scratch` isn't available as an alternative inside a loop, since the scheduler
refreshes it per phase node rather than per iteration. Full contract +
the safety trade-off in [`spec/06-workflow-engine.md`](../../spec/06-workflow-engine.md).

**Templated phase budgets.** `timeout_seconds` and
`generic_loop.max_iterations` take either a plain positive integer or
`{ from: <dotted context path> }`. `from` is the same lookup
`{{a.b}}` performs, resolved once before the first iteration
(`resolveTemplatedNumber`, in the engine's `core/templated-number.ts`).
**There is no numeric fallback (issue #385):** a `from` that resolves to
nothing usable throws, naming the key — config is the single source of every
budget. (A legacy `default: N` is still accepted for overlay-forked YAML and
falls back with a warning; packaged workflows never use it.) Both fix workflows
read `fix.localIterations` / `gate.timeoutSeconds` this way, against the run's
effective (already repo-clamped) blocks; build reads `gate.phaseTimeoutSeconds`.
An agent phase's `timeout_seconds` bounds each agent run (standard and
reviewer-loop phases); on a `generic_loop` phase it bounds only the
`until_bash` check, which otherwise reads `timeouts.untilBashSeconds`.

**Soft-failure policy (`generic_loop.on_soft_failure`).** By default any
non-success iteration hard-fails the whole workflow. That's wrong for a
long interactive loop like `explore`'s `socratic` phase: a single degenerate
turn — the agent exits cleanly but emits no final text and no `agent_end`, so
`mapStopReason` returns `"unknown"` (a *soft* outcome, distinct from a real
crash) — would discard every accumulated Q&A round. Declaring
`on_soft_failure: { retries: N, then: fail | complete }` makes the loop
resilient: a soft iteration re-runs up to `N` times (under a distinct
`_iter_n_retry` ledger label), and if it's *still* soft, `then: complete`
treats the loop as finished (as if `until` matched) and advances downstream
with the work gathered so far, while `then: fail` (the default) keeps the
old hard-fail. The soft/hard split is the generic `isSoftOutcome(result)`
classifier (phase-executor.ts, shared with the reviewer loop's fallback
recovery) — soft = `stopReason` `unknown` / `error_truncated`; hard =
terminated / `error_fatal` / `error_tool` / `error_exit_*`. Field absent ⇒
today's behavior exactly (only `explore.yaml`'s socratic phase opts in).

**No-op / empty-completion backstops.** Two guards stop a run that never
produced a real result from passing green — see
[`spec/06-workflow-engine.md`](../../spec/06-workflow-engine.md) for the
contract: (1) `on_output.requires_marker: "<MARKER>"` fails a phase whose final
output lacks the marker (a per-workflow postcondition — e.g. dependabot-pr-merge
requires `ASSESSMENT_COMPLETE`); (2) `reclassifySuccess` (executors/shared.ts)
demotes a terminal `agent_end` that carried **no final answer** (an empty
completion, including agentic-pi's synthesized backstop) from `success` to the
soft `unknown`, so it fails a plain phase and retries in a loop.

## Per-phase sandbox requirement (`requires_sandbox`)

A phase can declare `requires_sandbox: docker | gondolin | none` to gate itself
on the backend the harness is actually running. If the active backend (the
run-level `config.sandbox`, defaulting to gondolin) doesn't match, the scheduler
**silently skips** the phase — recorded as a *non-failing* skip in the
`executions` ledger, exactly like a trigger-rule skip, and surfaced via the
phase's `messages.on_skipped_done`. This is safe-by-default graceful
degradation for phases whose tooling is baked only into a specific sandbox image
(e.g. a future `/demo` video-render step that needs the docker image): on a
gondolin-only host the step no-ops instead of failing the workflow.

The gate lives in `runWorkflow`'s scheduling loop (it filters ready nodes before
execution), not in `phaseConfigFor`. Because a skipped node is not `succeeded`,
a downstream phase depending on a gated phase via the default `all_success` rule
would itself skip — keep gated phases **terminal**, or give their dependants
`trigger_rule: all_done`.

### Per-phase sandbox image (`sandbox_image`)

A phase can declare `sandbox_image: qa` to run on the enriched browser-QA image
(`lastlight-sandbox-qa:latest` — Playwright + Chromium baked in) instead of the
lean default (`lastlight-sandbox:latest`). The field is overlaid by
`phaseConfigFor` onto `ExecutorConfig.sandboxImage`; only the docker path acts on
it (the orchestrator's `withSandbox` resolves `imageName` from `sandbox_image`
and passes it to `sandboxFor`; the `DockerSandbox` adapter forwards it to
`createTaskSandbox({ imageName })`). The image name is a fixed constant in
`src/sandbox/images.ts` (`SANDBOX_IMAGE_QA`) — not env-overridable.

Pair it with `requires_sandbox: docker` so the phase skips on gondolin. On the
docker backend the scheduler *also* skips it when the QA image isn't built
(`qaImageAvailable()` in `images.ts`, kept docker-free so the runner can import
it), recorded as the same non-failing skip. So the phase runs only where browser
QA is genuinely possible; otherwise it no-ops. This is the Tier B browser-QA
mechanism — see `docs/tier-b-browser-qa-scope.md` and `skills/browser-qa/`.

## Conditional skip (`skip_if`)

A phase can declare `skip_if:` — one expression, or a list (OR-ed) — evaluated
when the node becomes *ready*, against `{ ...ctx, phaseOutputs, scratch }`. A
match takes the **same non-failing skip path** as `requires_sandbox` above, so
the run still records `succeeded`. The grammar is the `until:` one
(`core/loop-eval.ts`); the useful form is a dotted read of a value an upstream
phase already **parsed** into `scratch`, e.g.
`scratch.fixMarkers.diagnosis.class == 'flaky'` on `pr-fix`/`dependabot-ci-fix`.
A `.contains()` against `phaseOutputs.<phase>` is available and is what those
rows used to do — don't: that is a substring match on the agent's whole
free-form output, so prose ("this is not `class=flaky`…") and a replayed
`{{priorAttempts}}` line both match it, `class=flaky-timeout` matches while
`class=probably-flaky` doesn't, and it is empty across a resume boundary (next
paragraph) so it fails open on exactly the verdicts it guards.

`requires_sandbox` gates on the phase being *unavailable*; `skip_if` gates on it
being *unnecessary*. The distinction from `on_output.contains_BLOCKED:
{action: fail}` is the whole point: a phase whose correct outcome is "there is
nothing downstream to do" must not paint the run red — a red run posts
`messages.on_failure`, offers a Retry that cannot succeed, pollutes the cost and
failure stats, and defeats the SHA dedup (which ignores failed runs).

Two scoping notes: `phaseOutputs` is empty across a resume boundary (see the
caveat above), so a guard that must survive resume should read `scratch`; and
every expression fails **open** — an unrecognised form or an absent variable
runs the phase. The `all_success` caveat for downstream phases applies here too.

**The guard list is composed per run, not just declared.** The grammar has no
negation, so a conditional row is not expressible — and the `flaky` cap needs
one ("skip on `class=flaky`, *unless* this PR already deferred twice"). Its
second term is a fact about the PR known before the run starts, so
`promoteFlakyDiagnosis` (`simple.ts`) drops that one expression from the `fix`
phase when `flakyDeferrals >= fix.maxFlakyDeferrals`, on a shallow copy of the
loader's cached definition (it is a process-global). Same seam, same run:
`escalateFixModel` swaps `models["pr-fix"]` for `models["pr-fix-retry"]` above
`fix.escalateModelAfterAttempt`, before `context.models` is persisted so the
admin panel shows the model the attempt used. Both read off `request.extra`,
where `renderContext` put them at dispatch, and both are inert when those are
absent — `promoteFlakyDiagnosis` reads `flakyDeferrals`, and `escalateFixModel`
reads `priorAttempts.length` rather than `attempt`: `attempt` re-arms on a push
or a recorded retry, the journal survives a retry, so the journal is the count
that knows how many times the PR has actually been tried.

## Per-phase egress policy

Any phase can declare `unrestricted_egress: true` to bypass the sandbox
HTTP egress allowlist for that phase only. Default (field absent or
`false`) runs with the allowlist from `src/sandbox/egress-allowlist.ts` —
GitHub, LLM provider hosts, public package registries. When `true`:

- **gondolin**: agentic-pi receives `allowedHttpHosts: ["*"]` (wildcard
  allow-all). The QEMU-layer block is bypassed but private-IP rules at
  lower layers still apply.
- **docker**: the sandbox container's `--dns` flag points at
  `coredns-open` (172.30.0.11) instead of `coredns-strict`. That coredns
  resolves any hostname to `nginx-egress-open`'s IP, which tunnels
  whatever SNI it sees. Cloud-metadata literals (`169.254.169.254`,
  `metadata.google.internal`) are still NXDOMAIN'd by coredns-open as
  a hard SSRF floor.

Use sparingly — this is the exfil control the allowlist exists to enforce.
Typical use case is an `explore` phase that needs to search third-party
documentation. The setting is propagated by `phaseConfigFor()` in
`runner.ts`, which overlays `phase.unrestricted_egress` onto the
`ExecutorConfig` before each `runPhase` call.

A sibling YAML field, `web_search: true`, opts the phase into
agentic-pi's `web_search` / `web_fetch` tools. It uses the same
`phaseConfigFor` overlay and the same opt-in-per-phase convention as
`unrestricted_egress`. Phases that opt into web search usually also
want `unrestricted_egress: true` because `web_fetch` against
third-party docs goes through the same firewall path. See the
"Environment" section of the top-level `CLAUDE.md` for the required
provider env vars.

## Per-phase command policy (`command_policy`)

An agent phase or fan-out branch can allow / log / block the `install`,
`install-scratch` and `test` bash command classes (issue #403). The schema and
the templated-mode resolver are `packages/workflow-engine/src/core/command-policy.ts`;
`phaseConfigFor` resolves it onto `ExecutorConfig.commandPolicy` (so it needs
the run `ctx` — every call site passes it); the orchestrator forwards it as the
`commandPolicy` run option and the `AGENTIC_PI_COMMAND_POLICY` sandbox env; the
enforcement and pattern table live in `packages/agentic-pi/src/command-policy.ts`.
A branch policy replaces the phase's whole (`fanout.ts` `branchPhase`). A
`{ from: key }` mode with no `default` throws when the key is absent — the
pr-review keys (`probeTestPolicy`, `probeScratchInstallPolicy`,
`reviewInstallPolicy`) are seeded in `pr-decisions.ts` `specContext`, so a test
that hand-builds a pr-review context must seed them too.

## One scheduler (every workflow is a DAG)

There is a single scheduler — no separate linear/DAG paths. `runWorkflow`
builds a DAG with `buildDag(phases, { chainIfNoDeps: true })`:

- **No `depends_on`** (every production workflow) → chain synthesis adds
  `depends_on: [previousPhase]` (`all_success`) to each phase, reproducing the
  old linear semantics including the failure cascade.
- **Any `depends_on` declared** (only `examples/parallel-review.yaml`) → the
  declared edges are used as-is.

The scheduler then loops `while (!isComplete(dag))`: it skips nodes whose
trigger rule fails (a failure cascades down the chain as **skips**, recorded
in the `executions` ledger), and runs the earliest-declared ready node — **one
at a time, sequentially, in declaration order**.

**Concurrency across DAG nodes is still deferred** (it needs per-phase git
worktrees; see `docs/plans/deterministic-pr-levers.md` §WP5 for
the four blockers). **Concurrency *within* a node exists today** — `type:
fanout` runs N agent sessions against the one provisioned workspace. See "Phase
types" above.

- **One workspace.** Every phase and every loop iteration uses the single
  `ctx.taskId`. The sandbox workspace persists between phases (architect writes
  `plan.md`, executor reads it). The old DAG path's per-phase
  `${taskId}-${phaseName}` clones are gone.
- **Uniform skip semantics.** A node runs iff its trigger rule is satisfied by
  its deps' statuses; otherwise it is skipped (no downstream agent calls; the
  run ends `success: false`). `isTerminated` errors (OOM/cancel) are not
  reported as phase failures, and the failing node's error propagates to the
  run.
- Loop iterations run serially within their node because each fix cycle reads
  the previous reviewer verdict.

## Loop iteration naming

The dashboard's pipeline diagram and the approval gate state machine both
rely on predictable phase names for dynamically-created iterations.

```
First reviewer pass       → reviewer
  approves                → workflow continues
  requests changes
    Fix cycle 1           → reviewer_fix_1       (runs the executor with fix_prompt)
    Re-review (cycle 1)   → reviewer_recheck_1   (runs reviewer again)
    …
    Fix cycle 2           → reviewer_fix_2
    Re-review (cycle 2)   → reviewer_recheck_2
```

All generated labels are built by `PhaseRef.format()` (`phase-ref.ts`) — the
single authority — and parsed back via `PhaseRef.parse()` (base + kind).
`n` is the 1-based **cycle**; `fix_k` and `recheck_k` pair within a
cycle:

- `${parentPhaseName}` — the initial run
- `${parentPhaseName}_fix_${n}` — the nth fix cycle
- `${parentPhaseName}_recheck_${n}` — the nth re-review
- `${parentPhaseName}_iter_${n}` — generic-loop iteration n
- `${parentPhaseName}_iter_${n}_retry` — the one-shot retry of a generic-loop
  iteration whose first attempt came back soft (see `on_soft_failure` above); it
  gets its own ledger row so resume/dedup treats it as a distinct step, and the
  dashboard's longest-prefix grouping still nests it under the parent
- `${parentPhaseName}_iter_${n}_check` — the `generic_loop.until_bash` exit
  check that follows iteration n (see "Recording the loop" below). Ledger row
  only: it is never a phase, never enters `phase_history`, and never becomes
  `current_phase`.
- `${parentPhaseName}_branch_${name}` — one branch of a `type: fanout` phase,
  plus `_retry` (its one-shot soft retry), `_check` (its `until_bash` gate) and
  `_regate` (its `on_branch_gate_failure` re-run).
  This is why a fanout **branch name may not contain an underscore** and may not
  end in `-retry`/`-check`/`-regate`: the name is a ledger key and `PhaseRef` parses these
  suffixes off it. The schema rejects both, and `parse()` is ordered so the
  suffixed forms win.

The legacy bare-numeric re-review form (`reviewer_2`) is **dropped** — it was
untagged, ambiguous with literal phase names, and inconsistent with the
`_fix_`/`_iter_` tags. It is neither produced nor recognized on resume.

The dashboard's `WorkflowPipeline.tsx` uses a longest-prefix match to
group these under the declared parent (`reviewer_fix_1` → belongs to
`reviewer`; `fix_iter_1_check` → belongs to `fix`) and stacks them vertically
below that column in the pipeline diagram.

### Recording the loop

**An iteration is persisted when its WORK finishes, not when the loop's exit
condition resolves.** Everything after the agent turn — the `until` expression
and especially the `until_bash` command — is the loop asking "are we done?", not
the iteration still working. So `persistPhase(<phase>_iter_N, "iteration N —
work complete")` and the iteration's `recordOutputText` both fire *before* the
condition is evaluated. Prod run `49c101aa` is why: it sat 6m48s in `until_bash`
advertising `currentPhase: "diagnose"` (a phase that had ended 12 minutes
earlier) with `fix_iter_1` missing from `phase_history` although it had
completed.

**`until_bash` gets its own `executions` row** (`<phase>_iter_N_check`) —
`recordStart` before the command, `recordFinish` + `recordOutputText` after. It
is a real sandbox command that can run for minutes, and an open row with a start
time is how every renderer already draws "in flight, since N". Two deliberate
properties:

- It **bypasses** `runPhaseLedger` / `shouldRunPhase`. A condition must be
  re-evaluated every time it is asked; a dedup hit replaying a stale verdict
  against a since-changed workspace is the bug the row exists to expose. Its
  dedup key is distinct from the iteration's, so it can never mark a phase done
  or be resumed into.
- `success` records whether the check **ran**, not what it said. A red gate is
  the loop working as designed, so the verdict lands in `stop_reason` as
  `condition_met` / `condition_not_met`. The dashboard renders the latter as its
  own muted `unmet` tone (neither green nor red) and the CLI as `↻`.

When the condition IS met, a *second* history entry is appended for the same
label (`iteration N — condition met`). Two distinct events, and keeping them
apart is what makes the gap legible; every reader folds a repeated label
last-wins (the pipeline's history `Map`, both resume paths' `Set` of names,
`PhaseDetailPanel`'s `.at(-1)`). Covered by
`tests/workflows/generic-loop-check-row.test.ts`.

## Approval gates

Any phase can declare `approval_gate: <name>` (or `loop.approval_gate:
<name>`). When the runner reaches one it:

1. Calls `persistPhase(phaseName, …)` so the `phase_history` records it.
2. Writes a row to `workflow_approvals` with status `pending`.
3. Sets the workflow run status to `paused` and returns
   `{ success: true, paused: true, phases }`. The dispatch path in
   `src/index.ts` swallows this as a non-failure.

A gate can also name the artifact it's asking a human to approve via
`approval_artifact: <filename>` (alongside `approval_gate` / inside `loop:`),
e.g. `architect-plan.md` or `reviewer-verdict.md`. The filename is stored on
the `workflow_approvals` row (`artifact` column) and powers the **focused
approval view** (below). The gate's `approval_gate_message` can deep-link to
that view with the `{{approvalUrl}}` template helper — `PhaseExecutor.
pauseForApproval` injects the freshly-minted `approvalId` into the message
render context, and `{{approvalUrl}}` renders `${publicUrl}/admin/?approval=<id>`
(empty when no `PUBLIC_URL` is configured, so the rest of the message still
posts). This works identically for GitHub- and Slack-initiated runs — both
build the same template context with `publicUrl = callbacks.publicUrl`.

The user then resolves the gate via one of:

- **GitHub comment**: `@last-light approve` / `@last-light reject <reason>`.
  Router classifies it and dispatches the `approval-response` skill.
- **Slack slash**: `/approve [workflowRunId]`, `/reject [id] [reason]`.
- **Dashboard**: approve/reject button on the workflow detail page, or the
  **focused approval view** at `/admin/?approval=<id>` (deep-linked from the
  gate message / the run-detail banner's "Open focused review" link). It loads
  `GET /admin/api/approvals/:id`, which enriches the approval with an
  `artifactRef` derived from the run (`context.owner` + bare `repo` +
  `buildAssetIssueKey`): in **server** storage mode the view embeds the
  artifact editor (edit + save the store doc, then approve); in **repo** mode it
  links out to the doc's file on GitHub (`context.branch` + `issueDir`). Both
  approve/reject go through the same `POST /approvals/:id/respond` →
  `config.resumeWorkflow` path as the inline button.

All three paths funnel into the same `resumeWorkflowRun(run, sender)`
callback wired in `src/index.ts`. It updates `workflow_approvals`,
flips the run back to `running`, and re-enters `runSimpleWorkflow`. The
runner re-runs from the top and the `executions` ledger (`shouldRunPhase`)
skips already-completed phases, so the re-entry picks up exactly where it
paused. For a standalone **approve** gate the gated phase is already `done` so
the runner proceeds past it; for a **reply** gate the generic-loop node resumes
from `scratch.iteration`. A **reviewer-loop** gate (`loop.approval_gate`) is
mid-loop, so it persists `scratch["rloop:<phase>"].pausedAtCycle` before
pausing and persists each review's output: on resume the loop re-derives the
prior review's verdict from that output (a dedup-`done` review is **not**
assumed APPROVED) and runs the fix cycle for the approved gate rather than
re-pausing. No `currentPhase`-reset scaffolding is involved.

## taskId scoping

Linear and DAG runs compute the taskId once in `simple.ts` and store it
on `workflow_runs.context.taskId`:

```
${repo}-${issueNumber}-${workflowName}-${runId.slice(0, 8)}
```

- Includes the run id suffix so two parallel runs against the same
  issue can't collide on the sandbox workspace.
- The scheduler passes this exact taskId to every `runPhase` call →
  all phases **and all loop iterations** share one workspace (fixes read
  the reviewer's output from the same checkout). The old DAG path's
  per-phase `${taskId}-${phaseName}` clones are gone.

`resume.ts` reconstructs the taskId from the stored `context.taskId` so
a resumed run lands in the same sandbox dir the original started in.

**Per-PR reuse exception (issue #107).** A workflow declaring
`workspace: per-target-reuse` (`pr-review`, `pr-fix`, `dependabot-ci-fix`,
`dependabot-pr-merge`) **drops** the run-id
suffix — their taskId is keyed by (repo, PR) rather than per-run. A
re-review of the same PR (push → `synchronize`, cron PR-review fanout)
therefore lands in the **same** sandbox dir, so `prePopulateWorkspace` does
`git fetch` + `reset --hard` + `git clean -fdx -e node_modules` instead of
a fresh 1.3G clone + full install, and N dirs/PR collapse to 1 (cutting the
#106 churn at its source).

**The fix family shares one workspace.** Every workflow declaring
`pr_fix_shaped: true` (`pr-fix`, `dependabot-ci-fix`) uses the *same*
key, `${repo}-${prNumber}-fix`, rather than `…-${workflowName}`. The
PR-scoped run lock (below) means only one of them can be in flight for a PR
at a time, so two directories were pure waste — and routing genuinely
varies: an `@bot fix this` comment on a red Dependabot PR is an LLM
decision that can land on either workflow, so attempt 2 would otherwise
re-clone and re-install from cold just because the event arrived
differently. Everything else keeps `${repo}-${number}-${workflowName}`;
`dependabot-pr-merge` has no checkout to share and `pr-review` must not
share a tree with an agent that is rewriting it.

**Per-target recreate (issue #153).** `workspace: per-target-recreate`
(`build`) *also* drops the run-id suffix (taskId `${repo}-${issueNumber}-build`)
so a re-triggered build lands in the **same** sandbox dir — but on a
*different*-run marker it **deletes the leftover checkout and re-clones from the
default branch** instead of refreshing the (stale) feature branch. An incomplete
build is therefore disposable: re-running it starts again off current `main`,
and its `lastlight/N-slug` branch is always cut from the latest default, never a
stale pushed branch. This is driven by `recreateFromBase` on `GitSandboxAccess`
/ `PrePopulateSpec` (set in `gitSandboxAccessForWorkflow`).

Concurrency on a PR is held off by the **PR-scoped run lock** — the
`runInFlight` field of the snapshot the dispatch gate resolves
(`src/engine/pr-state.ts`; one live run at a time across `pr-fix`,
`dependabot-ci-fix`, `dependabot-pr-merge`, `pr-review`, `paused` included,
because a paused run still owns its workspace). This is not a refinement of the
old `isRunning(skill, triggerId)` guard: **that guard never worked at all.** It
is called with a bare workflow name and a bare issue number, while every phase
ledger row is written by `phase-executor.ts` with `skill = "<workflow>:<phase>"`
and `trigger_id = "owner/repo#N"` — no row could ever match both predicates, so
it always returned false. It survives only for the non-PR workflows, which have
no snapshot. Everything else here is unchanged: `runs.getByTrigger` reuse, and
the cross-run vs same-run distinction made by
a `<workDir>/.lastlight-run` marker stamped with the owning run id (same id →
preserve the checkout for the next phase — the architect's `plan.md` survives;
different id → refresh for pr-review/pr-fix, recreate-from-base for build). The
workspace-provisioning policy sets live in `src/workflows/target-policy.ts`; the
clone logic is in `src/sandbox/index.ts`.

## Per-repo config layer (issue #180)

The target repo may commit a `.lastlight/` directory that overrides a bounded
subset of config for runs against itself (full contract:
`apps/server/CLAUDE.md` → "Per-repo config layer", `spec/02-configuration.md`).
What the runner has to know:

- **Where it enters.** `resolveRepoRunConfig` (`simple.ts`) runs once at the
  `dispatchWorkflow` choke point in `src/index.ts` and the result rides
  `SimpleWorkflowRequest.repoConfig`. `runWorkflow` takes it as a trailing,
  **defaulted** 10th parameter — defaulted so `runWorkflow.length` stays 9, the
  frozen `lastlight/evals` surface pinned by `evals-contract.test.ts`.
- **Effective maps, not deltas.** `repoConfig.models` / `.variants` / `.approval`
  are already `base ⊕ repo`, so `simple.ts` and `runWorkflow` just substitute
  them (`effectiveModels`, `effectiveVariants`, `effectiveApproval`) — the
  `{{models.<phase>}}` template chain and `gateEnabled` need no knowledge of the
  layer. No repo layer ⇒ these are the caller's own maps by identity.
- **Per-run asset resolver, never a global.** `runAssetResolver()` builds
  `createAssetResolver([...getAssetLayers(), makeLayer("repo", assetRoot)],
  getDisabledAssets(), { agentContextAdditiveOnly: true })` and that resolver
  backs `EnginePorts.assets` (`loadPromptTemplate` + `resolveSkillPaths`) for the
  whole run. **Not** `configureWorkflowAssets` — several workflows and a cron
  fan-out are in flight at once, so mutating the module globals would leak one
  repo's prompts into another run.
- **Agent context is composed once, here.** `runAgentContext()` calls
  `assets.loadAgentContext()` and the result is threaded as
  `ExecutorConfig.agentContext`. This is the *only* channel by which a repo's
  `agent-context/*.md` reaches `AGENTS.md`, and `agentContextAdditiveOnly` is
  what stops a repo shadowing `soul.md` / `rules.md` / `security.md`. Downstream
  (the orchestrator's workspace write, the k8s `AgentContextSink`) uses the value
  verbatim.
- **Failure rule.** Every step above is best-effort: a missing cache dir or an
  unreadable file drops the layer with a logged warning and the run continues on
  the operator's assets. A repo's config can never fail a run.
- **Reporting.** Resolver warnings (a dropped repo agent-context file) are
  written to `workflow_runs.scratch.repoConfig.assetWarnings` in `runWorkflow`'s
  `finally`, so a failed run still explains what was ignored.
- **Resume restores, never re-resolves.** `resume.ts` rebuilds the layer from
  `context.repoConfig` (`restoreRepoRunConfig`), pinning the asset tree by exact
  tree sha; an edit made while the run was paused/queued/dead cannot retarget it
  mid-flight. If the tree is gone, the asset layer is dropped with a
  `scratch.repoConfig.restoreWarnings` note rather than swapped for today's.

## Templates

`templates.ts` renders phase prompts, approval-gate messages, and
notification strings. Variables come from two places:

- **Run-scoped context** built in `simple.ts`: `owner`, `repo`,
  `issueNumber`, `issueTitle`, `issueBody`, `issueLabels`, `commentBody`,
  `sender`, `branch`, `taskId`, `issueDir`, `contextSnapshot`, plus the
  **effective** `models` / `variants` maps (the repo layer already folded in)
  and `...request.extra`.
- **Phase-scoped context** assembled inside `runPhase`: `phaseOutputs`
  (a map keyed by declared `output_var` in each phase), `fixCycle`
  (loop only), and the most recent `previousOutput`.

Loop phases render the `fix_prompt` and `re_review_prompt` through the
same engine, so they can reference `{{phaseOutputs.reviewer.output}}`
and similar.

## Testing

Unit tests for every non-trivial piece live alongside the source:

- `runner.test.ts` — covers the unified scheduler: chain + declared-DAG
  workflows, context phases, loop cycles, approval gates, ledger-driven
  resume, guardrails bypass, sequential ordering, one-workspace, and
  skip-in-ledger.
- `phase-executor.test.ts` — direct unit tests for `PhaseExecutor.execute`
  with fake collaborators (each per-phase body, gates, dedup).
- `golden-build.test.ts` — pins `build.yaml`'s phase sequence under the
  unified scheduler (regression guard against reorders).
- `dag.test.ts` — pure graph scheduling + chain synthesis.
- `loader.test.ts` — YAML validation.
- `templates.test.ts` — variable substitution and `unless_*`.
- `loop-eval.test.ts` — expression evaluator.

Run them with `npx vitest run src/workflows/` from the repo root.
