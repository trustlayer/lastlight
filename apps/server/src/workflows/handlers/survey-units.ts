/**
 * The `type: survey-units` phase — the model half of the per-unit survey
 * (`docs/plans/pr-review-units-sites.md`).
 *
 * `lastlight-facts units` (a bash phase, in the sandbox) has already cut the PR
 * into units and rendered each one's COMPLETE request. This handler does only
 * model I/O: one bounded, non-agentic call per unit, the phase's prompt as the
 * system prompt and `unit.request` verbatim as the user message, then one
 * `units/responses/<unitId>.json` per unit for `lastlight-facts units-ingest`
 * to validate and turn into `hypotheses/<family>.jsonl`. Core does not depend
 * on `lastlight-code-facts` and must not start to — the package drags tsgo and
 * ast-grep natives into the agent image — so the FILE CONTRACT is the whole
 * interface.
 *
 * **Why in-process rather than an agent phase.** A unit is a single request
 * with no tools. An agent session would spend its turns re-deriving, with bash,
 * the context the request already carries — which is the cost this engine
 * exists to remove.
 *
 * **Only host-checkout backends.** The handler reads and writes the workspace
 * from the harness. `kubernetes` has no host checkout (its paths are in-pod;
 * see {@link HOST_READABLE_WORKSPACE}), so `loadConfig` refuses
 * `review.analysis.enabled` there at startup; the run-time check below is a guard
 * that degrades, never the primary refusal.
 *
 * **Degrade, don't fail.** Every path INSIDE the phase — no `units.json`, an
 * empty or unreadable one, every call failing, the phase deadline, a cancel —
 * ends in a SUCCEEDED phase with a loud summary and a warn log. A red phase
 * here would post nothing and re-arm the review sweep, while `units-ingest`
 * (which runs either way) already records every obligation no unit answered.
 *
 * **Visible like any other phase.** One virtual session transcript through
 * {@link AgenticShim} (one `survey_unit` tool call per model call, so a retry
 * or a cache hit is its own pair), and one `executions` row through
 * {@link runLedgeredPhase} carrying that session id and the summed cost. The
 * dashboard finds a phase's transcript ONLY via `executions.session_id`, stats
 * cost only off that row, and the evals harness costs a phase off the
 * transcript's `result` line — so all three are load-bearing.

 *
 * No explicit `maxTokens`: pi-ai sends the model's own output cap
 * (`options.maxTokens ?? model.maxTokens`), the most generous value there is,

 * **Prompt caching.** The handler moves code-facts' byte-identical

 * OUT of the user message and onto the end of the system prompt, so every call
 * of a phase opens with the same system text. `cacheRetention: "short"` is

 * env cannot silently double the write price of a phase that re-asks within
 * minutes, not hours. What each provider does with it differs:
 *  - Anthropic caches only at explicit breakpoints. pi-ai folds
 *    `Context.systemPrompt` into a leading system message and emits it as
 *    `system: [{ type: "text", text, cache_control: { type: "ephemeral" } }]`
 *    (plus a second breakpoint on the last user block), so the system text —
 *    prompt AND shared prefix — is the cross-unit cache hit. It is cached only
 *    above the model's minimum cacheable length.
 *  - OpenAI-family prefix caching is automatic over any identical prefix
 *    (≥1024 tokens); `cacheKey` goes out as `prompt_cache_key` to keep
 *    concurrent calls on one cache.
