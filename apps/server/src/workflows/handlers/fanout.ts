/**
 * How many agent sessions a backend may have in flight against ONE provisioned
 * workspace.
 *
 * This is the safety valve, and the asymmetry in it is the whole point.
 *
 *  - **`none`** runs agentic-pi in the harness process. `InProcessSandbox.runAgent`
 *    holds no per-call mutable state — every per-run value (`githubAuthEnv`,
 *    `authFile`, `sandboxEnv`, `cwd`, `allowedHttpHosts`) travels as an explicit
 *    argument, and issue #215 made that true *precisely because* concurrent
 *    in-process runs share `process.env`. So N concurrent turns are safe, and
 *    this is the backend the eval harness uses.
 *  - **`docker`** is N `docker exec`s into the one container the phase already
 *    provisioned.
 *  - **`gondolin`** boots a QEMU micro-VM per agent session, inside the harness
 *    process. That is WP5's D7 exactly, and the nearform host has no swap, a
 *    hard agent memory cap, and has wedged under memory pressure before.
 *  - **`smol` / `kubernetes`** are simply unverified for concurrent turns.
 *
 * The last three clamp to 1, which runs the branches sequentially — byte-identical
 * to the chained phases this replaced. That costs nothing today: the review
 * evidence pipeline cannot run in production at all until `lastlight-facts` is
 * in the sandbox image (WP2), and until then the only thing that fans out is the
 * eval harness on `none`.
