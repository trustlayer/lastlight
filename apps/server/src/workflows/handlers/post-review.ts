/**
 * Is this hypothesis row a CLEAN DISCHARGE — the pass saying *"I looked, I
 * quote the line, and it is fine"*?
 *
 * Two conditions, and each one is defensive about a shape that was actually
 * measured on disk:
 *
 * 1. **`discharge` OR `status`, case-insensitively**, mirroring `codeOf` in
 *    `code-facts`' `discharge.ts` so the gate and the boundary can never
 *    disagree about whether a row was discharged. Rows are heterogeneous: some
 *    carry neither (the `spec` pass's invented `{verdict, rationale, path,
 *    line, obligation}` shape), and a dead family writes `{status:
 *    "notMeasured"}`. Neither is a QUOTE, so neither is clean.
 * 2. **`failureScenario` PRESENT and explicitly `null`**, not merely absent —
 *    and this is the load-bearing half. The rule being read is the row shape's
 *    own contract, *"on a clean QUOTE write `failureScenario: null`"*, so it is
 *    a SELF-REPORT: a row that never wrote the key made no report at all.
 *
 *    Measured, and it decides the `--contract minimal` question. Across the two
 *    preserved 2026-08-22 runs (the pre-`full` contract, which never asked for
 *    the field) **37 rows are `QUOTE` with no `failureScenario` key, and every
 *    single one is from `spec.jsonl`'s invented `{claim, status, path, line,
 *    evidence}` shape** — a shape with nowhere to record a scenario, so its
 *    silence carries no information. Under the `full` contract of 2026-08-23,
 *    71 of 78 clean rows write the key explicitly. Requiring it therefore costs
 *    **zero findings** on the full-contract runs (17 / 14 / 7 demoted either
 *    way) and makes the rule a **true no-op** on every minimal-contract run,
 *    where the loose reading would have silently demoted 28 findings on the
 *    strength of a field nobody asked for.

 * Which hypothesis ids in `<dir>/hypotheses/*.jsonl` are clean discharges.

 * caller passes it straight through, so no pipeline ⇒ byte-identical output.
 * (An empty set behaves identically by construction: `every` over a non-empty
 * id list against an empty set is false. The distinction is kept for the log.)
 *
 * Identity is assigned exactly as `code-facts`' `readHypothesisSet` assigns it,
 * because the ids in `findings[].hypotheses[]` came out of that reader's own
 * `--ledger`: canonical **`<family>-NNN`**, family from the FILENAME (the
 * survey branch owns its file, so the name is authoritative in a way a
 * self-reported field is not), ordinal from position in an append-only file.
 * A model-declared `id` is honoured as an **alias** only when exactly one row
 * claims it and it shadows no canonical id — an ambiguous alias resolves to
 * nothing, which leaves the finding on the confidence path rather than crediting
 * whichever file sorted first.
 *
 * Parsing is defensive throughout: a torn final line on a killed run is normal
 * and must not throw. Note that a line that parses to a non-object still
 * consumes its ordinal, because `readHypothesisSet` counts it — an ordinal that
 * drifted from the ledger's would mis-resolve every later citation in the file.

   *
   * nearform/skillspro#1641 is the case, and it is worth being exact about why
   * the trigger-gate half of #271 does not cover it. Two APPROVEs, six minutes
   * and 400 identical bytes apart, on two head SHAs whose two-dot delta is
   * `package-lock.json` **plus** `package.json` and `jest.config.js` — a force-
   * push amend, materially different by any file-level test, so
   * `resolveReviewTrigger`'s generated-only gate correctly lets it through. The
   * only thing that identifies it as a duplicate is the review text itself, and
   * that is not knowable until the agent has written it.
   *
   * So this saves the DUPLICATE COMMENT, not the money — the run has already
   * happened by the time we get here. It is deliberately the narrowest rule
   * that catches the observed shape:
   *
   * - the same `body`, byte for byte, as our last posted review;
   * - `APPROVE` with **no** inline comments on both sides.
   *
   * The APPROVE restriction is not squeamishness, it is the check run. Skipping
   * the post means `concludeReviewCheck` finds no review at this head and
   * concludes `neutral`. `neutral` and `success` both pass branch protection, so
   * suppressing a duplicate APPROVE changes nothing; suppressing a duplicate
   * CHANGES_REQUESTED would turn a `failure` check into a passing one and open
   * a merge gate the review deliberately closed.
   *
   * Off for an EXPLICIT request, and that is not a courtesy — it is the same
   * rule `resolveReviewPost` applies one guard above. The shape this catches is
   * an unprompted re-review of a push that changed nothing a reviewer can read;
   * a maintainer who typed `@bot review` on an unchanged head is asking for
   * precisely the review this would suppress, and would get eight minutes of
   * pipeline and silence. Suppressing a duplicate APPROVE is safe (the check
   * concludes `neutral`, which passes) — but so is posting one, and only one of
   * the two answers the question.
