 *
 * ## Why this keys on `priorAttempts`, not on `attempt`
 *
 * Locked decision 10 (03-retry-intervention.md). `attempt` is a BUDGET
 * position: it re-arms to 1 whenever the problem becomes fresh, which is now
 * true for a recorded retry as well as for a push. Keying the model on it meant
 * a PR that had already failed three times on the escalated model was retried
 * on the BASE model the moment a maintainer asked for another go — the exact
 * opposite of what asking for another go means.
 *
 * `priorAttempts` is the journal, and locked decision 8 makes it the field that
 * SURVIVES a retry. So its length is the thing that actually knows how many
 * times this has been tried, and `attempt` goes back to being purely a budget.
 * A push still wipes the journal, which is right: the code changed, so the
 * earlier attempts are not evidence that this one needs a stronger model.
 *
 * The journal also carries a one-line SEAM per retry, so the count runs one
 * ahead of the attempt count per intervention. That is the conservative
 * direction — it escalates the model slightly sooner on a PR a human has
 * already had to intervene on — and it keeps this a plain `length` read rather
 * than a parse of the rendered lines.
 *
 * `resolveModelVariant` renders `model:` templates against `run.ctx` **only**,
 * so `{{attempt}}` inside a `model:` template cannot work without an engine
 * change. Rewriting the map here is the cheapest correct route: no engine
 * change, no YAML change, and it composes with the per-repo `models` override
 * (issue #180) for free because the map handed in is already the merged
 * `base ⊕ repo` one.
 *
 * Done BEFORE the map is persisted on `context.models`, deliberately: the admin
 * panel renders that map, so an operator can see which model an attempt actually
 * used — and `resume.ts` reads a resumed run's models back off that same stored
 * value rather than re-deriving one, so a restart mid-attempt does not silently
 * demote the model. (A repo layer that pins its own `pr-fix` re-applies that
 * leaf on restore, which is the one case where the escalation does not survive.)
 *
 * Returns the map **by identity** when nothing applies, so a deployment with no
 * `pr-fix-retry` key cannot tell this function exists.
