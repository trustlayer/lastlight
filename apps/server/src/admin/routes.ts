 * Exchange an OAuth2 authorization code for an access token — our own tiny
 * confidential-client (Basic-auth) exchange, used instead of arctic's
 * `validateAuthorizationCode` for the dashboard's GitHub + Slack logins.
 *
 * Why not arctic: arctic's `createOAuth2Request` **pre-sets a `Content-Length`
 * header** on the token POST. That's fine on Node's built-in fetch, but an
 * in-process agent run (agentic-pi / pi-ai) replaces Node's global undici
 * dispatcher with a non-default undici build ("poisons" the global fetch — see
 * `sandbox.ts` + `chat-skills.ts`), and that dispatcher **rejects a manually-set
 * Content-Length** with `UND_ERR_INVALID_ARG: invalid content-length header`.
 * Result: once any in-process run has happened, every GitHub/Slack OAuth login
 * throws `ArcticFetchError` and users can't sign in. The follow-up userInfo GETs
 * work because they carry no body / no Content-Length.
 *
 * The fix is simply to not set Content-Length ourselves — undici computes it

  // ── Un-stick a pull request — the third retry surface ─────────────────────
  //
  // EXTRACTED from the route below so the pipeline board's card actions reach
  // this exact path rather than growing a second one. The board offers "Retry
  // run" on a PR card; had that posted somewhere new, `resolvePrState` +
  // `applyPrDispatchGate` would have acquired a second caller free to resolve a
  // different snapshot or skip a branch — which is the drift the PR gate's
  // copies already caused once. One function, one decision point, two callers.
  //
  // `lastlight pr retry <owner/repo#N> [reason]` and (eventually) the dashboard.
  // The other two surfaces are a `@<bot> retry` comment and taking
  // `requires-human` off by hand; all three write the SAME record
  // (`PrState.intervention`) and re-arm through the one `sameProblem` boundary —
  // see `docs/plans/stuck-pr-recovery/03-retry-intervention.md` and
  // `spec/05-router.md` → "Un-sticking an escalated PR".
  //
  // Modelled on `cron trigger` above: the route owns the guards and the shape,
  // an injected callback owns the runner. Authorisation is the admin session
  // (the `authMiddleware` at the top of this file); `by` is that session's
  // identity, recorded for display only — per locked decision 5 no decision
  // function reads WHO asked.
  //
  // ## Why it dispatches, and why it can't just record
  //
  // `resolvePrState` + `recordIntervention` alone would persist the ask and
  // leave the next event to act on it. That is right for the comment/label
  // surfaces, which arrive ON an event that is already dispatching. It is wrong
  // here: an escalated PR is by definition one no further `check_suite` will
  // fire for, so "the next event" is the daily sweep at best and nothing at all
  // for a PR no cron covers — `lastlight pr retry` would report success and
  // change nothing anyone could see. The RECORD does survive being parked
  // (`applyDerivedState` keeps the head un-assessed until a run has served the
  // ask), which is what makes the standalone row worth writing at all; what
  // dispatching buys is the asker an answer.
  //
  // Which is why this crosses `applyPrDispatchGate` itself rather than letting
  // `dispatchWorkflow` do it: the snapshot travels down on `_prState` (it must —
  // it carries the intervention), and an inherited snapshot is exactly the signal
  // `dispatchWorkflow` reads as "this route already decided". The route that
  // resolves is the route that gates; the dispatcher does the same thing for the
  // same reason. The gate is what makes a retry NOT override the hold label, the
  // fork guard, the run lock, `upstream-broken` or a degraded read — and, on the
  // skips that are none of those, what records the standalone `retry-requested`
  // row so the ask survives to the next event.

  // ── Start a build from the pipeline board ─────────────────────────────────
  //
  // The board's one mutating action on an ISSUE card. Everything else it offers
  // already had an endpoint — approve/reject resolve through
  // `POST /approvals/:id/respond`, cancel/retry through the workflow-run
  // routes, and a PR card's retry through `retryPullRequest` above — so this is
  // the only new surface Phase 7 adds.
  //
  // ## It crosses a gate; it does not dispatch blind
  //
  // `dispatchWorkflow` already guards the managed-repo allowlist, the repo's
  // own `disabled.workflows`, and the PR gate. What nothing guarded was the
  // ISSUE hold on a dashboard-initiated dispatch: a card whose issue carries
  // the hold label would have dispatched, because the hold is checked inside
  // `applyBuildDispatchGate` and nothing on this path had reached it. So this
  // route crosses that gate itself, for the same reason the PR retry above
  // crosses `applyPrDispatchGate` itself: the route that answers a human is the
  // route that has to be able to TELL them why not, and a fire-and-forget
  // dispatch can only ever answer "accepted".
  //
  // `dispatchWorkflow` then crosses the build gate a SECOND time, and that is
  // deliberate rather than tolerated. The context carries `_stage`, which is
  // what `engine/stage-observer.ts` reads to move the issue off the `running`
  // label when the run ends — drop it to dodge the second gate and every
  // board-started build strands on `agent-building` forever, which is precisely
  // the bug that module exists to prevent. The second crossing is harmless
  // because the consequence it applies is idempotent: `addLabels` re-adding a
  // label the issue already carries is a no-op, and `removeLabel` swallows the
  // 404 that means "already gone" (`stage-observer.ts` makes the same argument
  // about its own re-firing). The choke point stays the choke point; this route
  // just gets to answer first.

  // ── Move an issue between pipeline columns ────────────────────────────────
  //
  // `POST /issues/:owner/:repo/:number/stage`, body `{ to, from? }`. The drag
  // gesture on the board, and the second — last — mutating action it offers on
  // an issue card.
  //
  // ## There is no pipeline table, so a "move" is a label write
  //
  // The stage LABEL is the source of truth for where an issue has got to
  // (`stage-labels.ts`, `stage-advance.ts`). Nothing else records a column: the
  // board (`board.ts`) is a projection of the open issues GitHub reports and the
  // stage label each one carries. So moving a card cannot be a row update — it
  // is `advanceStage`, the same add-then-remove the harness performs host-side
  // at every dispatch, driven from a browser instead of from a run. We go
  // through that module rather than calling `addLabels`/`removeLabel` here
  // because its ORDERING is load-bearing: add first, and a half-failure leaves
  // the issue carrying both labels (visible, reconcilable); remove first, and a
  // half-failure drops it out of the pipeline entirely with nothing on it to
  // see. Its header makes the full argument.
  //
  // ## THE SECURITY PROPERTY: `to` is checked against the CONFIGURED labels
  //
  // This route lets an authenticated browser session write a label to a managed
  // repository. Unchecked, that is not "move a card" — it is "apply an
  // arbitrary label to any issue in any managed repo", which is a different and
  // much larger capability than the gesture implies (`good first issue`,
  // `security`, a label some other automation gates on). So `to` must be one of
  // the labels the OPERATOR configured under `autonomy.stages` — every
  // `enter` / `running` / `on_success` / `on_failure` across every stage — and
  // anything else is a 400, before a single GitHub call. `from` is checked the
  // same way, since it names a label we would REMOVE. The one extra value is
  // the empty string, meaning "off the board": remove `from`, add nothing.
  //
  // ## It writes a label AND, on the two build columns, dispatches
  //
  // A drag onto a stage's `enter` or `running` column is the same instruction
  // as the Dispatch button above, made with a different gesture, so it crosses
  // the SAME gate with the same standing: `route: "api"`, `senderIsBot: false`,
  // because a browser session is a human by construction. The two TERMINAL
  // columns (`on_success` / `on_failure`) and `""` move the card and start
  // nothing — "done" is not a request to build, and `on_failure` is also the
  // budget-exhausted comment's de-dup key, which a dispatch here would fight.
  //
  // **The bot skip is NOT relaxed, and this is the paragraph to read before
  // changing any of it.** `resolveBuildTrigger`'s `already-built` branch still
  // hard-skips a BOT re-label, which is what stops label ping-pong — a stage
  // observer's own write re-triggering the stage it just left. What changed is
  // that this route no longer *relies* on that webhook chain to start a build:
  // it asks the gate directly, as the person who dragged. Previously it did
  // rely on it, and the cost was invisible from the UI — our own label write
  // arrives with `senderIsBot: true`, so re-dragging an already-built issue
  // (every guardrails failure, every `agent-blocked` card) wrote the label and
  // started NOTHING, silently, with no affordance on the card saying why.
  //
  // ## The ORDER differs by column, and the reason is a race
  //
  // Only `stage.enter` is matched by the router's `stageForLabel`, so only an
  // `enter` write echoes back to us as a dispatchable webhook. Writing it and
  // THEN dispatching opens a real window: between our `addLabels` and
  // `createRun` the echo arrives, reads `alreadyBuilt: false` and
  // `runInFlight: false` — so the bot skip never even applies — and dispatches
  // a second time. `simple.ts` then reuses the run row (it dedups only a
