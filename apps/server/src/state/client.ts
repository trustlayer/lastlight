/**
 * The Drizzle client seam.
 *
 * Store code is written ONCE, typed against the sqlite Drizzle instance — the
 * production path. A Postgres instance (Phase 4, PGlite in tests) is adapted
 * through the `asStateClient()` cast below. That is sound because the
 * query-builder surface the stores use (`select` / `insert` / `update` /
 * `delete` / `transaction`) is structurally identical across drivers; the two
 * genuinely divergent surfaces — raw SQL execution and rows-affected shape —
 * are funneled through `rows()` / `run()` / `changes()` in `dialect.ts`.
 *
 * **The cast alone is NOT enough, and this is the one thing to remember here.**
 * The query-builder surface is portable but PER-COLUMN VALUE MAPPING is not: a
 * `sqliteTable` object driven by a PG client sends `1` into a `boolean` column
 * (sqlite's `mapToDriverValue`; `PgBoolean` has none) and runs `JSON.parse`
 * over an already-parsed jsonb object. Booleans break on WRITE, JSON on READ,
 * and `dialect.ts` cannot see either. So no store may import its tables from
 * `./schema/sqlite.js` — they resolve them per dialect through
 * {@link tablesOf}, which hands back `schema/sqlite.ts`'s objects on the sqlite
 * leg and `schema/pg.ts`'s on the Postgres one, from the same code.
 *
 * Backend selection is construction-time injection (`StateDb.open` /
 * `StateDb.fromClient`), never a module-load env global, so both dialects can
 * be constructed in one test process.

 *    which node-postgres hands back as a STRING. PGlite ≥0.5 parses it to a
 *    number by default; a real PG client must be configured to
 *    (`types.setTypeParser(20, Number)`), or every aggregate silently arrives
