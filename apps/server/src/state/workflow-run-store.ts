 * independent of its run, so the cross-table ops call the approval store's
 * single-table writes from inside this store's transaction, passing the
 * transaction handle as their trailing `dbc` argument. Both stores MUST be
 * built from the same client — a transaction is per-connection.
 *
 * Every op that opens a transaction runs through the injected
 * {@link OpSerializer}, the ONE connection-scoped mutex shared with
 * `TeamStore`: overlapping libsql interactive transactions fail in ways
 * `busy_timeout` cannot help with (it is connection-scoped, and the client
 * swaps connections after each transaction). Plain writes racing those
 * transactions are covered one layer down, by the client-level SQLite write
 * lock (`sqlite-write-lock.ts`) — which is why every write inside a
 * transaction callback must go through `tx`, never `this.client`.
 *
 * The long-running re-dispatch (`dispatchWorkflow`, which spawns a Docker
 * sandbox for minutes) is deliberately NOT part of any transaction here. The
 * atomic boundary is the DB mutations only; the caller dispatches after the
 * op returns.

   * TTL-dropped from the queue after a server death, and a manual dashboard
   * cancel — neither of which is a permanent verdict. Guarded by
   * `WHERE status IN ('failed','cancelled')` and returns the changed-row count

   * click sees 0 rows changed and does NOT dispatch again.

   * Clearing the error is an app-side read-modify-write now (see
   * {@link readContext}); the CAS still rides on this one UPDATE, and a run in a
   * terminal status has no other writer to race the read against.
