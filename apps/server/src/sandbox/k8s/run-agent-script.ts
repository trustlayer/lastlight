 *    flags {@link agentRunFlags} decided. Its real exit code is captured
 *    (`rc=$?`) rather than left to a bare `exec`, so step 2 can run
 *    afterwards without masking it. (The resolved agent-context reaches the
 *    workspace root as `AGENTS.md` via the agent-context initContainer —
 *    `init-agent-context.ts`, nearform#240 — not this script.)
 * 2. When `artifactUpload` is set: a best-effort tar+upload of `.lastlight/`
 *    (`|| true` — a hiccup here must never turn a successful agent run into
 *    a reported failure) to the harness's `/internal/sandbox-artifacts`
 *    route, bearer-authed with `$LASTLIGHT_ARTIFACT_TOKEN` (env, not argv).
 * 3. `exit $rc` — restores the agent's own result regardless of step 2.
