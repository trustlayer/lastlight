/**
 * Sandbox resource usage, read from the sandbox's OWN cgroup v2 files.
 *
 * Every docker container and every k8s pod container runs in a private cgroup
 * namespace, so inside it `/sys/fs/cgroup` is exactly that sandbox's cgroup:
 *
 * - `cpu.stat` `usage_usec` — cumulative CPU time of everything that ran in it
 *   (the agentic-pi harness plus every tool it spawned). Exact, no sampling.
 * - `memory.peak` — the high-water mark (kernel >= 5.19; absent before).
 * - `memory.max` — the limit, or the literal `max` when unlimited.
 *
 * One shell snippet reads all three and prints ONE marker line, so both
 * backends share a single reader and a single parser: docker runs it through
 * `docker exec` just before teardown; k8s appends it to the pod's script and
 * picks the line off the log stream it already follows (the server pod can see
 * neither the sandbox's cgroup nor, without new RBAC, any metrics API).
