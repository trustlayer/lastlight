/**
 * Shared pipeline node presentation, used by BOTH the workflow-run pipeline
 * (WorkflowPipeline) and the read-only definition diagram
 * (WorkflowDefinitionDiagram) so the two views stay visually identical.
 *
 * A phase renders as a two-part card: a tinted HEADER strip carrying the phase
 * type's icon, the label, and a right-hand marker slot; and a BODY carrying
 * what the phase did. Runs put the outcome summary and a time·duration line in
 * the body; definitions put the phase id and its metadata tags there. Approval
 * gates render as the diamond decision shape regardless of source.
 *
 * ## The one rule: type owns hue, status owns surface
 *
 * A reader must never confuse "this is an agent phase" with "this phase
 * failed", so the two facts never share a visual channel:
 *
 * | channel                        | carries |
 * | ------------------------------ | ------- |
 * | the type icon's colour + glyph | TYPE    |
 * | border + body wash             | STATUS  |
 * | header right-slot dot          | STATUS  |
 * | connector dots + edge stroke   | STATUS  |
 * | header right-slot badges       | the phase's DECLARATIONS (gate / loop) |
 *
 * Type draws from its OWN four hues (`--ll-type-*` in `index.css`), and status
 * only from `success` / `error` / `info` / `warning` / `base-300`. The type
 * hues are separate tokens rather than daisyUI's `primary` / `secondary` /
 * `accent` because two of those are both green in the light theme, which
 * collapsed agent and post-review into one colour.
 *
 * Type is deliberately ONLY the icon. A tinted header strip was tried and
 * abandoned: a phase with no body renders as header-only, so the wash became
 * the entire card and a solid lavender block read as a status. The hint has to
 * sit under the signal, and a 14px glyph cannot outshout a border.
 */

 * `unmet` is the generic-loop `until_bash` exit-condition check that RAN and

 * designed — it is what earns the agent another iteration), so it gets its own

/**
 * A `type: fanout` phase, drawn as a CONTAINER its branches sit inside.
 *
 * React Flow expresses this with `parentId` on the children (positions become
 * relative to this node), which is why this is a custom type rather than the
 * built-in `group`: `group` has no handles, and the main left-to-right pipeline
 * has to enter and leave the fan-out like any other column.
 *
 * Containment is what says "these ran at once". The branches carry no edges
 * between them and none from this header — a fan-out has no first or last
 * branch, and any line drawn between them would assert an order the run does
 * not have. The card renders a header and then empty space; the children are
 * absolutely positioned into that space by the layout.
 *
 * It gets the shared header but deliberately NOT the left rail: dashed-plus-
 * rail reads as a mistake, and the dashed border is already the "this is a
 * region, not a card" signal.
 *
 * A WIDE fan-out (5+ branches — pr-review's `site-review` runs up to 16) is
 * drawn `compact` instead: no child cards, just a count strip and a chip per
 * branch, about two cards wide. The header's toggle swaps between the two.
