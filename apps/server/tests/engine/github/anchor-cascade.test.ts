/**
 * WP6a — the anchor cascade.
 *
 * The defect being fixed: `line` was a REQUIRED, model-produced field, and
 * `post-review` demotes anything outside the commentable set. So a finding whose
 * analysis is perfect and whose line number is off by two paid the full price of
 * a wrong answer — a body entry instead of an inline comment at the defect site,
 * which the attention-boundary evidence says is worth substantially less.
 *
 * These tests are the AC1a gate. The cross-file case (§3) is the one with a
 * trap under it: `alibaba/open-code-review` records that asking a model to
 * regenerate an excerpt against the WRONG file's diff yields a comment that
 * looks located while pointing at unrelated code. Hence "unique hit only", and
 * hence the ambiguity test below being as important as the success one.
