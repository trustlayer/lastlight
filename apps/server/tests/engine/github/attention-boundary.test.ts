/**
 * WP6b — the attention boundary.
 *
 * The line this work package walks: **a candidate is never deleted for being
 * noisy, but neither does every surviving candidate earn an inline comment.**
 * Preserving internal recall and spending a human's attention are two different
 * budgets, and v2 is what happens when they are conflated — a suppressor that
 * "worked mechanically" and cost recall anyway.
 *
 * So the tests below are mostly conservation tests. With 20 findings and a
 * budget of 8, the interesting assertion is not that 8 are inline; it is that
 * the other 12 are still in the body.
