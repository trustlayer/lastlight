/**
 * Table tests over literal {@link PrState} fixtures — no GitHub mock, no
 * sandbox, no harness.
 *
 * This is the payoff of 09-state-machine.md's reframe: once the PR's state is
 * ONE resolved snapshot, every policy question is a pure function over it, and
 * most of the plan's verification becomes a table. Each case names the sequence
 * it protects, and each asserts the REASON as well as the decision — the reason
 * is the thing rendered in the log line, the escalation comment and the admin
 * detail panel, so a decision whose justification drifted is a real regression
 * even when the boolean is unchanged.
