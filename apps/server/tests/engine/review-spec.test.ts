/**
 * The `spec` obligation family — WP0 of the review evidence pipeline.
 *
 * The assertions that matter most here are the NEGATIVE ones. IRIS's ablation
 * measured a one-ended seed at −3, *worse than seeding nothing*, so "we emit no
 * obligation when we cannot name the second end" is not a robustness nicety —
 * it is the property the whole family rests on, and the one that would fail
 * silently (an obligation would still be cut into a unit; the arm would just
 * measure worse and be read as "the spec axis does not work").
