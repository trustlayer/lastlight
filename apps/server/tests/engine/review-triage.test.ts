/**
 * The review DEPTH marker and its harvest (issue #378).
 *
 * The whole tier mechanism is one line of agent output. `REVIEW_DEPTH: light`
 * has to survive from the `triage` phase's output to the `skip_if` of seven
 * later phases and to three mutually exclusive arms of the review prompt, and
 * every way it can fail to do so must leave a FULL review behind.
 *
 * These tests are written against that direction rather than against the happy
 * path: most of them are malformed, absent or unrecognised markers, and each
 * asserts that the dispatch-time seed is left standing.
