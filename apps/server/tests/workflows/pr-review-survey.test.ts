 * WP3 acceptance criteria 3 and 4 of
 * `docs/plans/deterministic-pr-levers.md` §WP3.
 *
 * **AC3 — each survey pass writes only its own family's file.** The union is
 * append-only and collapse is meant to be impossible *by construction*: five
 * disjoint paths, and no pass ever opening another's. There is no harness code
 * to assert that on — the enforcement lives in the `until_bash` gate and the
 * prompt text — so what is checked here is what is actually enforceable: every
 * survey phase names ITS OWN family path and no other, and the five gates are
 * pairwise distinct.
 *
 * The assertions are on **paths**, never on words, and that distinction is the
 * whole test. Every one of the five prompts contains the word "contract" (the
 * *discharge* contract); `survey-enforcement.md` contains the word "state" ("or
 * state that no such line exists"). A word-level scan would pass while proving
 * nothing at all — so a non-vacuity control below pins that fact, and will fail
 * if anyone ever weakens these assertions back to word matching.
 *
 * **AC4 — `coverage: "degraded"` reaches the model.** The facts → obligations →
 * block hop lives in `packages/code-facts` (`renderFamilyBlock`, unit-tested
 * there). What this layer owns is the two ends of that chain: the `coverage:
 * "none"` envelope literal embedded in `pr-review.yaml`'s shell fallback, which
 * nothing type-checks; the path agreement between the seeder's `--blocks`
 * directory and the file each prompt tells the model to open; and — for the
 * `spec` family, whose obligations are built harness-side — the complete
 * in-process propagation from a degraded `PrState` to the rendered prompt.

/**
 * Regression guard for a bug these tests caught: `survey-spec.md` shipped its
 * fallback branch as `{{#unless specObligations}}…{{/unless}}`, and the template
 * engine does not implement `{{#unless}}`.
 *
 * `renderTemplate` handles `{{#if x}}…{{/if}}` (with a `!` negation) and bare
 * `{{x}}` only — `packages/workflow-engine/src/core/templates.ts`. `{{#unless}}`
 * matches neither production: `#` and `/` are outside the `[\w-]` key class, so
 * BOTH markers survived verbatim into the prompt AND the body between them was
 * emitted unconditionally. The model was therefore told "No spec obligations
 * were built for this PR … That is **not** a pass on this axis" *immediately
 * underneath a fully-populated obligation block* — the exact inversion of AC4,
 * telling the model nothing was analysed when something was.
 *
 * Nothing catches it upstream. `validateAssets` checks that a prompt file
 * RESOLVES, not that it renders; the post-render `{{`-leftover guard
 * (`validateShellCommand`) applies only to `type: bash` commands. So the
 * general assertion — no survey prompt leaves an unrendered marker — is the
 * guard, not a spot-check of the one branch that was wrong.

// ── One home per rule ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Every survey branch reads `survey-pass/SKILL.md` as its first action — 40 of
// 40 branches across one 8-case arm, because the prompt's opening line tells it
// to. So a rule stated in BOTH the skill and the prompt is read twice per
// branch and paid five times per case.
//
// The hedge that created the duplication was reasonable — Pi surfaces skills as
// a name+description catalogue and reads SKILL.md on demand, so anything
// load-bearing got copied into the prompt to guarantee it was seen. The read is
// now measured, so the copy is waste.
//
// Rule: shared survey guidance lives in the SKILL. A prompt carries the family's
// question, its obligations, its output file, and whatever needs a {{template}}
// (skills are never rendered, so `{{baseBranch}}` cannot live in one).
/*
 * ── Deliberately NOT tested here: the wording of a prompt or the skill ──────
 *
 * This file used to pin distinctive SENTENCES — that a rule lived in the skill
 * and was not restated in the six prompts, that each prompt said it had the
 * whole checkout, that it named the staged diff by relative path, that it
 * carried the cross-family prohibition, that a missing block is not a clean
 * result. Every one of those assertions failed the moment a prompt was
 * REWORDED, while the mechanism it stood for was untouched — so the suite
 * reported a regression for an edit that changed no behaviour, and the only
 * way to iterate on a prompt was to edit the test alongside it. A gate that
 * fires on paraphrase is not measuring the thing it names.
 *
 * The rules themselves are not lost and they are not optional. Each lives as a
 * comment beside the text it governs, where the next person to edit that text
 * will actually read it — see `skills/survey-pass/SKILL.md` and the six
 * `workflows/prompts/survey-*.md`. What stays under test here is MECHANISM:
 * which branch reads which file, which gate guards which family, which paths
 * must stay disjoint, what a degraded analysis renders, and that no template
 * marker survives into a rendered prompt. Those hold across any rewording and
 * break only when something really is wired wrong.
