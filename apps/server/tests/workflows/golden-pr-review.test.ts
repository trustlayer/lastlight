/**
 * Golden test: WP3's evidence pipeline must be INERT.
 *
 * Acceptance criterion 1 of `docs/plans/deterministic-pr-levers.md` §WP3:
 * with `review.analysis.enabled: false`, `pr-review` behaves exactly as it did
 * before the eight new phases existed. That is locked decision 8, and the
 * mechanism it rests on is a single context key — `analysisEnabled`, set ONLY by
 * `specContext()` in `pr-decisions.ts`, which returns `{}` unless the config
 * flag is on. Every new phase carries `skip_if: "analysisEnabled != true"`, and
 * `evalUntilExpression` coerces an ABSENT variable to `false`, so `!= true`
 * matches and the phase skips.
 *
 * This is modelled on `golden-build.test.ts` but has to go further than pinning
 * declaration order, because WP3 also converted `pr-review` from an implicit
 * linear chain into an EXPLICIT one. `buildDag`'s `anyDeclared` flag disables
 * chain synthesis for the WHOLE workflow the moment any phase declares an edge —
 * so the eight new `depends_on` keys silently turned `review` and `post-review`
 * into ROOT nodes, and only the two hand-written edges at the bottom of the YAML
 * put them back on the chain. Nothing about that is visible in the YAML text, so
 * the tests below resolve the DAG rather than reading it.

 * The `review` phase as it stands after f4: the pre-WP3 shape PLUS a

 * skills fallback, which serialises the ENTIRE render context as `key: value`
 * lines — that byte-for-byte dump guarantee is deliberately retired (an
 * analysis-mode review needs a different brief, and a template cannot
 * reproduce a dynamic dump). What replaces it is pinned below: the OFF
 * rendering keeps the skill nudge + a curated Context section and leaks
 * nothing pipeline-shaped; the LIGHT rendering is a light re-review's single
