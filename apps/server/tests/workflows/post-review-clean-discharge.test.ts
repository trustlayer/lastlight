/**
 * `readCleanDischarges` — the seam between the survey's JSONL and the attention
 * boundary.
 *
 * The boundary itself is a pure function and is table-tested in
 * `tests/engine/github/attention-boundary.test.ts`. What only this layer can
 * get wrong is the READ: which ids exist, which of them are clean, and what
 * happens to the four shapes that were actually found on disk — a `spec` pass
 * that invented its own row, a dead family writing `notMeasured`, a model-minted
 * id used as an alias, and a torn final line on a killed run.
 *
 * Identity must agree with `code-facts`' `readHypothesisSet`, because the ids in
 * `findings[].hypotheses[]` were produced by that reader's own `--ledger`. A
 * disagreement here would not throw; it would silently resolve a citation to the
 * wrong row, which is the failure mode the whole identity scheme exists to end.
