// ── `context_file` — the obligations reach the pass, or its absence is loud ───

/**
 * The defect this whole section exists to close, measured rather than inferred.
 *
 * Across the three stored `pr-review` runs of 2026-08-22
 * (`2026-08-22_{184650,194234,201607}`), 120 non-spec survey branches made 133
 * attempts to open their family's obligations block. **Every one of the 98
 * relative reads succeeded and every one of the 27 workspace-root ABSOLUTE
 * reads failed with ENOENT** — 23 branches never recovered and free-styled off
 * the diff instead, because the prompt's own escape hatch told them to. Neither
 * base is wrong; having two is. The model's only absolute anchor by its first
 * turn is its skill bundle at `<workspaceRoot>/.lastlight-skills/…`, one level
 * ABOVE the checkout the deterministic phases write in.
 *
 * `context_file` removes the resolution from the model: the harness reads the
 * file at `hostAgentCwd` — the host end of the very `cwd` a `type: bash` phase
 * runs in — and appends the bytes. What is asserted below is exactly that, plus
 * the property that makes it safe to ship: an unreadable file appends a LOUD
 * notice, never silence.
