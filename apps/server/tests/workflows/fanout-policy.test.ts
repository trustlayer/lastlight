/**
 * The soft-failure policy of the `survey` fan-out, read off the SHIPPED YAML as
 * an EFFECTIVE value.
 *
 * This test exists because of a specific, measured, silent failure. All six
 * survey phases declared `on_soft_failure: { retries: 1, then: complete }` at
 * PHASE level, where it belongs to `generic_loop` and zod therefore STRIPS it.
 * The policy silently reverted to `{ retries: 0, then: fail }`, so one degenerate
 * turn hard-failed the whole review — which records no
 * `assessedHeadShaByWorkflow` and hands `cron-review.yaml` something to
 * re-dispatch every thirty minutes, forever. It shipped that way until
 * 2026-08-22.
 *
 * A test asserting the KEY IS PRESENT in the YAML text would not have caught it,
 * because the key was present. What was absent was its effect. So every
 * assertion here reads the PARSED definition — the value the runner will
 * actually use — and the vacuity control at the bottom proves that reading can
 * fail.
