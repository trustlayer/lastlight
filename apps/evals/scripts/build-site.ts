/**
 * Assemble the static site that the Cloudflare Worker serves.
 *
 * Cloudflare Workers have NO filesystem at the edge, so the dashboard's two
 * dynamic endpoints — which `src/serve.ts` computes live from `eval-results/`
 * via `readdirSync` — have to be pre-baked into plain files here:
 *
 *   /api/index            ← buildIndex(eval-results)  (the filesystem scan)
 *   /api/micro            ← buildMicroIndex(eval-results) (micro-survey reports)
 *   /data/<tier>/<run>/…  ← a verbatim copy of eval-results/
 *
 * plus the dashboard SPA shell at the root. The result (`dist-site/`) is served
 * as static assets — no Worker code needed (the SPA uses hash routing, so every
 * app route resolves to `/index.html`). Re-run after new eval runs, then deploy.
 *
 * RESULTS SOURCE — prefer the live `eval-results/` (gitignored, present on a
 * machine that has run evals); fall back to the vendored `sample-results/` (a
 * committed run per tier) when it's absent or empty. That's what makes CI —
 * which has no `eval-results/` — deploy a real, representative dashboard instead
 * of an empty shell, WITHOUT running an eval in the build. A local `npm run
 * deploy` with real results still wins; the sample is just the floor.
