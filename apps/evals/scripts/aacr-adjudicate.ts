/**
 * Measure an **adjudicator** against Alibaba's AACR-Bench — "handed a review
 * comment somebody else wrote, can this arm tell a correct one from a wrong
 * one, and does it pay for that in recall?"
 *
 * This is a **measurement script**, not a test: it never asserts, never tunes,
 * and writes nothing unless `--out` is passed. It exists BEFORE
 * [WP6](docs/plans/deterministic-pr-levers.md#adjudication-and-the-attention-boundary-wp6) so WP6 has an
 * external target to hit, rather than being graded only by the instrument it
 * was designed against.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npx tsx scripts/aacr-adjudicate.ts [--arm <name>] [--limit N | --all]
 *       [--seed N] [--model <id>] [--concurrency N] [--dry-run] [--yes]
 *       [--dataset <path>] [--out [<resultsRoot>]] [--print-prompt] [--help]
 *
 *   --arm          keep-all (default) | drop-all | llm | jev  (see ARMS below)
 *   --limit N      sample size, deterministic + stratified  (default 50)
 *   --all          score all 2,145 rows. Required to go past --limit
 *   --seed N       sampling seed                            (default 1)
 *   --model <id>   judge model for the `llm` arm; else EVAL_JUDGE_MODEL, else
 *                  defaultJudgeModel(). For the `jev` arm it is the TypeSafe
 *                  model id; else TYPESAFE_MODEL, else `jev-latest`
 *   --jev-axis     which jev probability drives the decision and the sweep:
 *                  `useful` (default, matches AACR's label: correct AND worth
 *                  acting on, maintainability included) or `correct` (narrower —
 *                  names a real DEFECT, which drops most maintainability rows)
 *   --jev-threshold  the `jev` arm keeps iff P(axis) >= this  (default 0.5).
 *                  The sweep re-thresholds independently, so this only moves the
 *                  arm's own headline row
 *   --concurrency  parallel model calls                     (default 4)
 *   --dry-run      zero model calls; a stub decision drives the whole pipeline
 *   --yes          the spend acknowledgement. Without it, a model arm prints its
 *                  estimate and REFUSES
 *   --dataset      a local dataset.json instead of the cache
 *   --out          also write report.json + report.md (optionally under a
 *                  different results root)
 *   --print-prompt dump the first constructed prompt (llm arm) before deciding
 *   --help         print this block
 *
 * ── What this measures ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Exactly one thing: **given the text of a review comment plus its file/line
 * metadata, can an arm separate the expert-verified-correct ones from the
 * expert-verified-incorrect ones.** That is the WP6 adjudicate phase's job and
 * nothing else's.
 *
 * ── What this does NOT measure ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * **It is not review recall.** Every comment here already exists. Nothing in
 * this script asks whether *our* reviewer would ever have generated the comment
 * — which is the actual bottleneck (1 of 25 gold findings on skillspro) and the
 * thing WP3/WP4 exist to move. An arm can score 100% here and change review
 * recall by zero, because the recall loss happens upstream of adjudication.
 *
 * It is also **not comparable to AACR-Bench's own leaderboard**. That board
 * scores review *generation* — Open Code Review at 20.0% recall (301/1505),
 * Claude Code at 28.9% (435/1505), see
 * [external validation (WP9)](docs/plans/deterministic-pr-levers.md#external-validation-wp9).
 * Those denominators are the 1,505 label=1 rows treated as a gold set to be
 * *found*. Ours is a classification over rows already handed to us. Never put
 * the two in the same column (`01b` house rule: our number and theirs are never
 * averaged, pooled, or presented together).
 *
 * ── The dataset's own bias, carried in the output, not in a footnote ─────────
 *
 * **1,597 of the 2,145 comments are AI-generated** (GPT-5.2, Claude-4.5-Sonnet,
 * Qwen-Coder-480B, GLM-4.7, Deepseek-V3.2, Gemini-3-Pro) and then
 * expert-verified. Only **548 are human-authored**. So the set over-represents
 * the findings AI reviewers already produce, and an adjudicator tuned on it is
 * tuned to police machine output. The human-authored half is the more honest
 * distribution and is **always reported separately, never pooled** — a single
 * pooled retention figure is 74% a statement about how well we adjudicate other
 * models' comments.
 *
 * Base rates are close enough that the split is about provenance, not
 * difficulty: label=1 is 1114/1597 (69.8%) of AI rows and 391/548 (71.4%) of
 * human rows.
 *
 * ── The asymmetry this is built to detect ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * WP6's adjudicator **may re-rank, re-tier and DEMOTE, but may not DELETE a
 * finding without a probe transcript refuting it**, because filtering a
 * conservative reviewer has cost recall every single time it has been measured:
 * our own candidate v2 (micro-recall 1/25 → 2/25 but F1 halved — reverted),
 * BitsAI-CR's ReviewFilter (precision 54.5 → 67.1, recall 45.5 → **39.8**), and
 * Open Code Review's deterministic layer (discards ~5,100 findings to buy
 * precision and loses 134 real defects doing it).
 *
 * So **retention is the headline and interception is the sidebar**, not the
 * reverse. A high-interception arm is not a good arm; it is candidate v2.
 *
 * ── The metrics, and their denominators ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   retention     = kept / total, over label=1 rows ONLY. The recall-protecting
 *                   number. Arithmetically identical to the positive class's
 *                   recall below; both are printed because the *name* is the
 *                   point — this is the budget that must not be spent.
 *   interception  = dropped / total, over label=0 rows ONLY.
 *
 * The confusion matrix takes **"kept a valid comment" as the positive class**,
 * so precision/recall/F1 mean what they mean in the literature:
 *
 *   TP  label=1 & keep   FP  label=0 & keep
 *   FN  label=1 & drop   TN  label=0 & drop
 *
 * Note the floors this pins, and they are the reason the deterministic arms are
 * not filler. A bound is only a guard if the number it would be WITHOUT the
 * intervention is pinned too
 * ([the instrument, WP8](docs/plans/deterministic-pr-levers.md#the-instrument-wp8)):
 *
 *   keep-all   retention 100%  interception   0%   precision = the base rate
 *   drop-all   retention   0%  interception 100%   precision = undefined (0/0)
 *
 * `keep-all` is **what production does today** — there is no adjudicate phase —
 * so it is the rung-0 row, not a strawman. Any arm that does not beat its F1 is
 * costing recall for nothing.
 *
 * ── Every rate is printed with its n ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A rate over a tiny subset is not a measurement. Some language and category
 * cells are small (C# is 52 rows of 2,145; Security Vulnerability is 74), and at
 * `--limit 50` most cells are single digits. Cells with n < 20 are marked `†`.
 *
 * ── What is deliberately kept OUT of the prompt ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * `label`, `is_ai_comment`, `source_model`, `category` and `context` are never
 * shown to a model arm. The first three are direct leakage. The last two are
 * *annotator-assigned* fields, and feeding an annotation into the input while
 * also breaking the score down by it makes the breakdown circular. They are
 * scoring axes here, nothing more.
 *
 * ── An arm that errors is UNGRADED, never a silent decision ──────────────────
 *
 * A failed or unparseable model reply does not become a keep and does not become
 * a drop; the row is excluded from every denominator and the excluded count is
 * printed beside the headline. Silently defaulting an error to `keep` would
 * flatter retention, and to `drop` would flatter interception. Both are lies of
 * the kind 08-evals §5 already forbids for the pr-review judge.
 *
 * ── Why there is a `jev` arm ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every adjudicator we have measured reports a **decorative** confidence: median
 * 0.95–1.00 across findings, no threshold binds, so the whole inline/body/internal
 * boundary in `post-review` is gated on a number that does not vary
 * ([the found→said gap](docs/plans/deterministic-pr-levers.md)). The `sweep()`
 * below exists to test exactly that, and so far it has had nothing worth sweeping.
 *
 * TypeSafe's System One model (`jev`) is trained to return a **calibrated**
 * probability rather than generated text, so it is the first arm whose confidence
 * axis is a hypothesis rather than an artefact. That is the entire reason this arm
 * exists — not "another model", but *a different kind of number*. Read the sweep
 * before the headline row: if `t` does not move retention and interception apart,
 * the thesis is dead and no pipeline work is justified.
 *
 * The arm cannot be an adjudicator on its own — jev does not generate text, so it
 * can score a comment but never write, merge, or rephrase one.
