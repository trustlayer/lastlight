/**
 * Back-fill the evidence pipeline's own telemetry — and **internal recall** —
 * onto a scorecard measured before the instrument existed.
 *
 * `ReviewPipelineStats` was declared and consumed and never produced:
 * `boundaryMetrics()` and `familyFunnels()` (`src/review-metrics.ts`) both begin
 * by filtering for `review.pipeline`, and no run has ever carried one, so both
 * returned `undefined` on every measurement in the plan's history. The producer
 * now exists (`src/review-pipeline-stats.ts` + `run-instance.ts`), but it only
 * runs forward. The runs the plan's conclusions actually rest on are already
 * measured, and their workspaces were preserved — so the instrument can be
 * pointed at them retrospectively instead of re-running $7-17 arms.
 *
 * Two halves, and only one of them spends:
 *
 *  1. **Free.** `readPipelineArtifacts()` reads `obligations.json`,
 *     `hypotheses/*.jsonl`, `findings.json` and `disposition.json` out of the
 *     preserved workspace. Obligations, the discharge histogram, clean
 *     discharges, unprovenanced findings, the tier split, coverage — all
 *     deterministic, no model.
 *  2. **Spends.** Internal recall needs a judge: "did the pipeline FIND it at
 *     all?" is a different question from "did it SAY it?", and only the second is
 *     answerable from the posted review the original run already graded. One
 *     MATCH call per case (`gradeInternalRecall` — no EXTRACT step, because
 *     `findings.json` is already structured).
 *
 * The archived workspaces are laid out `<run>/<instance_id>/pr-review/` — the
 * `.lastlight` level is not in the archive — which is why `readPipelineArtifacts`
 * takes the artifact directory rather than the checkout.
 *
 * ── `--no-judge`: re-read the free half, keep the paid one ──────────────────
 *
 * The two halves age differently. The judge half is bought once and stays true:
 * a MATCH between the gold text and the findings the run generated does not
 * change when the *reader* changes. The mechanism half is a pure function of
 * artifacts on disk, so it goes stale the moment `readPipelineArtifacts` learns
 * something — and on 2026-08-23 it learned two things (a clean discharge now
 * requires `failureScenario` PRESENT and `null`, and citations resolve through
 * the canonical `<family>-NNN` identity). Re-running the whole back-fill to pick
 * those up would re-buy every MATCH call at full price to arrive at the same
 * answers.
 *
 * `--no-judge` therefore re-reads the artifacts, rewrites ONLY the mechanism
 * fields, and carries `internalMatched` / `internalGold` / `inlineMatched` /
 * `internalUngraded` and the per-family `matched` / `internalMatched` across
 * untouched
 * ({@link mergePreservedJudgement}). It makes zero model calls, so there is no
 * estimate and no confirmation — there is nothing to consent to. Two rules make
 * it safe to point at an already-published scorecard:
 *
 *  - **A run with no stored internal recall does not gain one.** The merge only
 *    ever copies a value that is already there; it never invents, and never
 *    turns a stored `internalUngraded` into a zero.
 *  - **It refuses to write if the judged half moved at all** ({@link judgedHalf}),
 *    alongside the existing published-number check. The whole promise of the mode
 *    is that the expensive column is untouched, so that promise is asserted
 *    rather than assumed.
 *
 * ── Safety, all of it bought with incidents (same rules as `rescore.ts`) ─────
 *
 *  - READ-ONLY unless `--write`; the write is tmp + rename, so a dashboard
 *    polling the file never reads half a JSON.
 *  - It prints a cost estimate and asks before spending, and refuses outright
 *    above `--max-spend` (default $1.00).
 *  - It REFUSES to write if any already-published number moved. Back-filling
 *    adds columns; it must not be able to rewrite the comparator every gate in
 *    `docs/plans/deterministic-pr-levers.md` is read against.
 *  - An errored judge call is EXCLUDED and NAMED, never folded in as 0.000. A
 *    judge outage and a pipeline that found nothing produce the same number, and
 *    that number is the most dangerous one this script could print.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npx tsx scripts/backfill-pipeline.ts <artifactDir> [more ...] \
 *       --results <eval-results/pr-review> [--env <dir>] [--write] [--yes] \
 *       [--judge-model <id>] [--max-spend <usd>]
 *   npx tsx scripts/backfill-pipeline.ts <artifactDir> --scorecard <path> [...]
 *   npx tsx scripts/backfill-pipeline.ts <artifactDir> [more ...] \
 *       --results <eval-results/pr-review> --no-judge [--write]   # free; keeps the judged half
 *
 * `<artifactDir>` is a preserved run's archive root (it holds one directory per
 * instance_id). Its scorecard is located by matching the archive's leading
 * `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS` against the run directories under `--results`; the derived
 * mapping is PRINTED before anything spends, and `--scorecard` overrides it for a
 * single archive. Nothing is guessed silently.

/**
 * A freshly-read mechanism half, wearing the judgement the scorecard already

 *
 * The split is not cosmetic. `withInternalRecall` builds the judged fields by
 * walking `internal.goldToFinding` back into `readout.findings` — it needs the
 * judge's reply, which only `internalGold` (the stored copy of that reply)
 * preserves, and only on runs measured after it existed. So the fields it
 * produced (`internalMatched`, `internalGold`, `inlineMatched`, and the
 * per-family `matched` / `internalMatched`) can only be CARRIED, never
 * recomputed, and this merge is the carry.
 *
 * Everything else on `fresh` wins outright: that is the point of re-reading.
 * Three rules earn their keep:
 *
 *  - **`prev === undefined` ⇒ `fresh`, unchanged.** A case that was never judged
 *    must not come out of here holding a number, and there is no shape of merge
 *    that could give it one.
 *  - **Only DEFINED values are copied.** A stored `internalUngraded` survives
 *    with `internalMatched` still absent, which is the one distinction the whole
 *    "a judge outage is not a recall of zero" rule rests on.
 *  - **A family the fresh read no longer knows is kept** for its judged columns
 *    alone. `withInternalRecall` mints a family row for a matched finding whose
 *    family has no obligations and no hypotheses file, so such a row legitimately
 *    exists in `prev` and legitimately does not in `fresh`; dropping it would
 *    silently lose a match.
