# @lastlight/evals-dashboard

The results explorer for the eval harness → **evals.lastlight.dev**. Private
(`@lastlight/evals-dashboard`), a **React + Vite + Tailwind** SPA.

It renders the eval-run artifacts produced by `lastlight-evals` (model comparisons,
per-tier scores, transcripts). The live site is deployed via the evals package's
Cloudflare `deploy` flow (**not** gh-pages, which is stale) and bakes in local
`eval-results/` at build time.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm --filter @lastlight/evals-dashboard dev        # vite dev server
pnpm --filter @lastlight/evals-dashboard build      # vite build → dist/
pnpm --filter @lastlight/evals-dashboard typecheck  # tsc --noEmit
pnpm --filter @lastlight/evals-dashboard test       # vitest run (node env)
```

See [`apps/evals/CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) for the harness, the release dance, and
how results are generated + deployed.

## Import the harness's arithmetic — do not mirror it

`src/types.ts` and `src/lib/summarize.ts` used to be hand-kept copies of the
harness's `src/schema.ts` / `src/report.ts`. The copy drifted silently: it omitted
`micro`, `boundaries` and `families`, so the dashboard fetched a scorecard
carrying micro-recall and threw it away, and showed the per-case F-beta mean as
the `pr-review` headline while every planning document reasoned in micro-recall.
Nothing failed; the UI just reported a different quantity from the one under
discussion.

So:

- **Result-shaped types are imported**, not re-declared —
  `import type { InstanceResult } from "../../src/schema.js"`. That module is
  types-only at runtime, so Vite erases it.
- **Metric arithmetic is imported** from `../../src/review-metrics.ts`, which is
  pure and has no Node APIs. `summarizeModels` in `src/lib/summarize.ts` remains a
  mirror **only** because the harness's copy lives in `src/report.ts`, which reads
  the filesystem — and `src/lib/summarize.test.ts` runs the harness function in
  Node and asserts field-for-field agreement, so the remaining copy cannot drift
  unnoticed.
- `tsconfig.json` therefore has `"node"` in `types` (the harness type graph
  reaches `node:fs`). Node globals consequently type-check in this browser app;
  don't use them.

## The runs table is grouped by ARM, not by model column

`src/lib/runGroups.ts` turns `/api/index` runs into the overview's table rows.
Two rules it exists to enforce:

- **A model is not a column.** The table used to grow one column per model id
  seen anywhere in the folder, so most cells were `—` and the *same* model
  appeared twice — `Claude Haiku 4.5` (the `models.json` label) and the raw
  `anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` the runs were actually launched against.
  `modelDisplay`/`modelKey` (`src/lib/format.ts`) collapse a pinned snapshot id
  onto its registry label and keep the full id in a `title`. The arm — overlay
  basename + model — is one cell of the run's own row.
- **A repeat band is one row.** Runs fold on `meta.repeat.group`; each repeat is
  a chip, and the mean ± band appears only once `of` repeats have landed (an
  in-flight band shows its landed chips plus an `n of m` spinner). `band` is
  `max − min`, the same definition as the harness's `VarianceRollup.band`.
  Nothing is grouped heuristically — the stamp is the only evidence, and
  guessing would fold a baseline in with the candidates it is the control for
  (the preserved 2026-08-22 runs carry no `repeat`/`overlay` meta at all and
  must stay ungrouped single rows).

`IndexRun` carries `models` / `overlay` / `repeat` for this, straight off
`meta` in the harness's `buildIndex` (`../src/report.ts`) — so the live `serve`
index and the baked static manifest (`../scripts/build-site.ts`) are the same
shape and the same component renders both.

## The funnel drill-down reads the pipeline's own artifacts

`src/lib/pipelineArtifacts.ts` + `src/components/FamilyDrilldown.tsx` turn each
row of the per-family funnel into the evidence behind it — the obligations, the
hypotheses, and what became of each. It is the **first UI to read
`results[].pipelineArtifactRel`**, which only exists because
`persistPipelineArtifacts()` now copies `.lastlight/pr-review/` into the run
directory unconditionally; before that the evidence lived in a `$TMPDIR`
workspace the OS reaped (216 of 237 recorded paths resolved, not one still held
a file). `src/serve.ts` already serves the run dir at `/data/*`, so there is no
new endpoint — the four documents are fetched lazily on open, via TanStack
Query, keyed on the artifact dir.

Three rules are mirrored from the harness's reader
(`../../src/review-pipeline-stats.ts`, which cannot be imported here — it opens
with `node:fs`) and pinned in `src/lib/pipelineArtifacts.test.ts`, because
getting any of them wrong renders a confident wrong answer rather than failing:

- **Hypothesis identity is POSITIONAL** — `<family>-NNN` from the FILENAME plus
  append order. The model-declared `id` is an alias at best; a torn line
  consumes no ordinal, a scalar line does.
- **The findings ↔ disposition join is `path + title`, never `line`** (the
  boundary re-anchors lines; keying on the line lost 10 of 32 findings).
- **Absent ≠ zero**, in four places the UI renders distinctly: a run with no
  artifacts ("artifacts not retained"), a missing `hypotheses/<family>.jsonl`
  (the survey never ran) vs an empty one, a missing `findings.json` (nothing is
  known about what became of the rows — *not* a conservation failure), and
  `notMeasured` vs 0. `spec` declares `measured: false` meaning "cannot COUNT"
  while its survey runs, so it is **not** marked notMeasured; `tests` declares
  it and writes only the tombstone, so it is.

One thing the artifacts cannot answer: `obligations.json`'s `dropped[]` is
`{reason, count}` with no ids, no text and no family field, so a dropped
obligation's *question* is nowhere on disk. The per-family dropped count is
`minted − obligations` (`families[]`), and the panel says so rather than
implying the questions are recoverable.

## The unit-survey page (`#/unit-survey`)

`src/components/UnitSurvey.tsx` renders `/api/unit-survey` (list) and one
report fetched from `/data/unit-survey/<id>.json` (detail: per-case table and the
gold only one side's judge credited). It mirrors the
micro-survey page — its own endpoint, its own reserved first hash segment
(`UNIT_SURVEY_TIER_KEY`), and a nav chip only when there are reports. Every cell
string comes from `src/lib/unitSurvey.ts` over the harness's node-free
`../src/unit-survey-index.ts`, and the one rule it pins
(`src/lib/unitSurvey.test.ts`): a side with no data — a stage-1 report, an
unjudged side, a fixture with no recorded agent survey — prints `n/a`, while a
measured zero still prints `0/4`. Units and agent always render as a pair.

Replays are **live**: the script writes the report at start and after every
case, with a 15 s heartbeat. Status is `unitSurveyStatus` (in
`unit-survey-index.ts`, shared with the index — running / done / failed /
stale, stale = `running` past the micro-survey's 90 s bar; no `status` = an
old one-shot report = done), rendered by `UnitStatusChip` with cases
done/planned and elapsed (`unitSurveyProgress`). Every total on a running or
stale report is over the cases done so far and is tagged **partial**. The index
and a running report's detail poll at 1.5 s while anything is `running`
(`unitSurveyActive`), 15 s otherwise. Unit-survey reports also appear in the
**home page's** "Recent runs", merged by time with the eval runs
(`src/lib/recentRuns.ts` → `mergeRecent`, tested) behind a `unit-survey` kind
chip, linking to `#/unit-survey/<id>`; micro-survey reports do not.

## The phase-replay page (`#/phase-replay`)

`src/components/PhaseReplay.tsx` renders `/api/phase-replay` (list) and one
report fetched from `/data/phase-replay/<id>.json` (detail: per-case table) —
the reports `scripts/micro-falsify.ts`, `scripts/micro-site-review.ts` and
`scripts/micro-select.ts` write, each tagged with a `falsify` /
`site-review` / `select` kind chip (`select` cases render their items —
importance, merged ids, posted vs recorded, the gold-credited ones in green). Same shape as the
unit-survey page: its own endpoint, its own reserved first hash segment
(`PHASE_REPLAY_TIER_KEY` in `src/lib/router.ts`), a nav chip only when there
are reports, and hooks in `src/lib/api.ts` (`usePhaseReplayIndex` polls at
1.5 s while any report is running, 15 s otherwise; `usePhaseReplayReport` at
1.5 s while live). Totals and status come from the harness's node-free
`../src/phase-replay.ts` (`phaseReplayTotals`, `phaseReplayStatus`), never a
local copy.

The rule it pins: **absent is not zero**. An audit (`--audit`, no model) has
no cost, wall clock or verdicts — they render `n/a` / *not run (audit)*, not
`$0.00` or `0` — and a gold count over an unjudged gold map is `null` and
renders `n/a`. Per-case quality numbers are min–max ranges, never means.
A `site-review` detail page also shows a **human grades** box (below).

## The grading page (`#/grade`)

`src/components/Grade.tsx` renders `/api/findings` — every finding a
site-review report flagged, deduplicated by label key — as cards grouped by
PR: title, path:line, mechanism, consequence, a ±8-line code excerpt from the
fixture, the case gold per instance, and where the finding appeared (report
label · instance · arm · repeat · site, the judge's gold match, a log
button). Controls: REAL? yes/no/unsure, IMPORTANCE (must-fix /
worth-mentioning / nit, shown only when real = yes), a "same as gold N"
select, a note, clear. Each click POSTs the full label to `/api/labels`;
`useSaveLabel` patches the `["findings"]` cache in place rather than
refetching, and cards graded this visit stay visible under the `ungraded`
filter. Keys: j/k, y/n/u, 1/2/3 (implies yes), x; n/u/1–3 advance.
`#/grade/<report-label>` pre-filters to one arm (`GRADE_TIER_KEY` in
`src/lib/router.ts`; the nav chip shows once a non-audit site-review report
exists). The per-arm table and the phase-replay page's `HumanGradesBox` both
come from `gradedMetrics` in the node-free `../src/labels.ts` — the key rule
and its trade-off are documented there, not here.

Machine proposals (`f.proposals`) render in a muted dashed "suggested by
<grader>" box, never in the human controls; "accept suggestion" (key `a`,
first grader) POSTs it as the human label. Extra filters: "disagrees with
suggestion" (`proposalAgrees` false) and "has suggestion, ungraded". The
header's per-grader agreement (n, % real agree, κ, confusion matrix) is
`agreementMetrics`, recomputed client-side so an in-place label patch updates it.

## Testing

`vitest.config.ts`, `environment: "node"` — everything worth testing here is pure
logic, and the highest-value test has to import the harness's Node-side
`report.ts`. Only reach for jsdom if you actually render components (`prismjs`,
pulled in by the diff viewer, needs a DOM at import time).

`src/__fixtures__/repeat-group.json` is the real three-run repeat group
(`2026-08-22_{184650,194234,201607}`) reduced to the per-gold judge verdicts. Its
published band — 0.320 / 0.080 / 0.200, union 0.440, intersection 0.040 — is
asserted in `src/lib/repeats.test.ts`.
