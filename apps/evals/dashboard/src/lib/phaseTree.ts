 * Two lists have to be reconciled to build these, and they do NOT agree:
 *
 *  - `scorecard.json` → `results[].phases[]` is the LEDGER — one row per phase
 *    the runner dispatched, including skipped ones, and for a `fanout` phase one
 *    row PER BRANCH (`survey_branch_contract`, …).
 *  - `sessions[].phases[]` is the ARCHIVE — one `NN-<phase>.jsonl` per phase
 *    WINDOW. A fan-out is one window, so its six branches share a single file.
 *
 * So on the same run the ledger says `survey_branch_{contract,…,spec}` (six
 * rows, no file) while the archive says `survey` (one file, no ledger row). The
 * panel needs the ledger's order and vocabulary with the archive's transcripts,
 * which is what {@link buildPhaseRows} joins. */
