/**
 * The JSON contracts the dashboard reads: `/api/index` and
 * `/data/.../scorecard.json`.
 *
 * **Result-shaped types are imported from the harness itself**, not mirrored.
 * `../../src/schema.ts` is types-only at runtime (its single import is an
 * `import type`), so Vite erases it entirely and tsc still checks us against the
 * real definitions. A hand-kept copy is how the dashboard came to be missing
 * `micro` for the whole life of that field — the copy could drift silently and
 * did.
 *
 * The *report*-shaped types (`ModelSummary`, `RunMeta`, the index) still live
 * here because their definitions sit in `../../src/report.ts`, which imports
 * `node:fs`/`node:path` and therefore cannot be pulled into a browser bundle or
 * type-checked under this package's DOM-only tsconfig. `lib/summarize.test.ts`
 * is the guard for that remaining copy: it runs the harness's own
 * `summarizeModels` in Node and asserts field-for-field agreement.
