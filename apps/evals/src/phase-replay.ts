/**
 * Phase replays — ONE pr-review phase (`falsify`, or the per-site
 * investigator `site-review`) re-run against preserved fixtures, in minutes
 * rather than a full arm's hours. (`adjudicate` replays existed too; the phase
 * and its script were removed, and their reports are no longer listed.)
 *
 * `scripts/micro-falsify.ts`, `scripts/micro-site-review.ts` and
 * `scripts/micro-select.ts` (the sites engine's `select` pass) write these
 * reports to `eval-results/phase-replay/*.json`; `/api/phase-replay` lists them
 * and the dashboard's `phase-replay` page renders them. This module is the ONE
 * definition of the report shape and of every number derived from it, and it
 * is **node-free** (like `micro-survey.ts` / `unit-survey-index.ts`) so the fs
 * scan and the browser cannot disagree about a figure.
 *
 * Why these two phases and why replay: measured on the first unit-survey arm
 * (2026-09-27), adjudicate on Sonnet 4.6 spent 8.7 minutes writing ~29k output
 * tokens for 52 rows and was still inside one turn at 12 minutes on 173, while
 * falsify was shown one owed row of 21 (the prompt keyed on a field the rows
 * never carry). Both are questions about ONE phase over a FIXED input — the
 * checkout, the hypotheses, the probe verdicts — so replaying that input holds
 * the upstream variance still and measures the phase alone.
 *
 * Absent is not zero, everywhere below: an unjudged grade is `null`, never a
 * zero recall; an audit (no model) has no cost rather than a free run.
