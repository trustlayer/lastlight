/**
 * Read the evidence pipeline's own telemetry off the artifacts it wrote.
 *
 * `ReviewPipelineStats` (`./schema.ts`) is the set of **mechanism metrics** that
 * `docs/plans/review-evidence-pipeline/08-evals.md` says WP3's and WP4's gates
 * are read on — obligations generated, discharge rate, the per-family funnel,
 * where findings landed. The reason it exists at all is that micro-recall over a
 * 25-finding gold set cannot resolve an improvement below ≈0.24
 * ({@link DETECTION_FLOOR_MICRO_RECALL}), while these have an n in the hundreds.
 *
 * **It was declared and consumed but never produced.** `boundaryMetrics()` and
 * `familyFunnels()` (`./review-metrics.ts`) both begin by filtering for
 * `review.pipeline`, and no run has ever carried one — so both returned
 * `undefined` on every measurement in the plan's history, and every decision
 * fell back to the one number the plan says never to steer on. This module is
 * the missing producer.
 *
 * Everything here is a deterministic read of files the run already wrote. No
 * model, no network, no spend — which is also what lets it be back-filled onto
 * preserved workspaces (`~/lastlight-run-artifacts/`).
 *
 * **Absent is not zero.** A baseline arm runs no pipeline and writes no
 * `.lastlight/pr-review/`; this returns `undefined` for it, and every consumer
 * degrades to posted-only rather than reporting a row of zeros.

/**
 * Fold the internal-recall pass into the stats, attributing each match back to

 *
 * That attribution is the point: it fills the per-family `matched` column of the
 * funnel, and `inlineMatched` for the attention boundary. Without it
 * `familyFunnels()` can say which family generated the most and never which one
 * was RIGHT — the difference between a volume metric and a quality one.
