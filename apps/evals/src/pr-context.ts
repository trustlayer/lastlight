/**
 * The PR state machine (issues #251, #252) — the eval harness's wiring.
 *
 * In production a PR-scoped workflow is never *called*; it is **dispatched**.
 * `dispatchWorkflow` resolves ONE `PrState` snapshot per dispatch and projects
 * it into the template context through `renderContext`, and that projection is
 * where the fix and merge prompts get essentially everything they reason with:
 * `{{ciSection}}`, `{{attempt}}` / `{{maxAttempts}}`, `{{priorAttempts}}`,
 * `{{priorNotes}}`, `{{verifyScript}}`, `{{flakyPromoted}}`, `{{mayMerge}}` and
 * its reason, `{{checksState}}`, `{{settledCheckCount}}`.
 *
 * A harness that builds its own `TemplateContext` by hand therefore does not run
 * a smaller version of production — it runs a DIFFERENT one, in which every
 * `{{#if}}` guard takes the empty branch and the agent is asked to diagnose a
 * red PR it has been told nothing about. Measuring that would be measuring the
 * harness, not the model.
 *
 * So this module does what `./repo-config.ts` does for the per-repo layer: it
 * supplies the one thing core normally reads from live GitHub (the snapshot),
 * and lets **core's own** `renderContext` do the projection, unmodified. There
 * is deliberately no second copy of that projection here — a copy is exactly the
 * defect issue #256 was filed about.
 *
 * ## How a case declares one
 *
 * ```jsonc
 * {
 *   "instance_id": "fix__flaky-timeout",
 *   "pr_state": {
 *     "attempt": 2,
 *     "checks_state": "failing",
 *     "ci_jobs": [{ "name": "CI / test", "log_excerpt": "…timed out…" }],
 *     "prior_attempts": ["DIAGNOSIS_COMPLETE: … class=flaky …"]
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Everything is optional; what a case omits takes a default that cannot itself
 * cause the agent to reason differently (a green-ish, first-attempt PR). The
 * fields are snake_case to match the rest of the dataset schema, and are mapped
 * onto core's camelCase `PrState` here rather than in the fixtures — so a
 * rename in core is a change in one place.
 *
 * ## What this does NOT do
 *
 * It does not evaluate the dispatch gate. `resolveFixDisposition` and friends
 * are pure functions over the snapshot, already table-tested in core without a
 * model; running them here would measure nothing new. What an eval can measure
 * — and unit tests cannot — is the half that needs a model: given a genuinely
 * red repository and a faithful context, does the agent reach the right
 * `class=`, and does it behave differently on the attempt where `flakyPromoted`
 * is set. The snapshot is therefore an INPUT here, never an assertion target.
