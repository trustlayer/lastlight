/**
 * Map a runner phase ROW back to the YAML `model:` template that governed it,
 * for scorecard RECORDING (`PhaseMetric.model`) in `config` runs.
 *
 * `wf.phases` rows carry LEDGER labels, not YAML phase names: a `type: fanout`
 * phase's branches come back as `<parent>_branch_<name>` (plus `_retry` /
 * `_check` — see `packages/workflow-engine/src/core/phase-ref.ts`, the single
 * authority for those labels). A naive `def.phases`-by-name lookup therefore
 * missed every branch row, and `recordPhaseModel(undefined, <label>)` fell all
 * the way through to `models.default` — the scorecard said surveys ran the
 * default model while the session envelopes proved otherwise (money trap 12
 * in `docs/plans/deterministic-pr-levers.md`; journal §2j in git history).
 * Execution was always correct (`fanout.ts:776` resolves
 * `branch.model ?? phase.model`); only the recording lied.
 *
 * So the label is parsed back through core's own `PhaseRef.parse`, and a branch
 * row resolves its template exactly as core's executor does
 * (`apps/server/src/workflows/handlers/fanout.ts` `branchConfig`):
 * `branch.model ?? phase.model`, with the PARENT phase name as the resolver's
 * fallback task. Non-branch rows keep the old behaviour byte-for-byte
 * (a declared name maps to its own `model:`; a loop-derived `_fix_`/`_iter_`
 * label maps to no template, as before — those run `fix_model`/the loop's own
 * config, which this recorder has never modelled).
