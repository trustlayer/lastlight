/**
 * Run ONE eval instance against the REAL production workflow with GitHub mocked.
 *
 * Flow:
 *   1. Start the fake GitHub (seeded from the instance's issue fixtures).
 *   2. (code-fix) Deterministically seed the workspace: fixture repo @ base
 *      commit + a local bare `origin` so `git push` works offline.
 *   3. Load the REAL workflow YAML (build / issue-triage / …) via the loader,
 *      and resolve the target repo's committed `.lastlight/` config layer (if
 *      the case declares one) through core's own dispatch-time resolver.
 *   4. runWorkflow with `sandbox` (default `"none"`; `"gondolin"` isolates the
 *      agent's tools in a QEMU micro-VM — see `opts.sandbox`), `githubApiBaseUrl
 *      → fake GitHub`, and an EMPTY approvalConfig so gates never pause. No real
 *      GitHub creds.
 *   5. Grade deterministically (execution + behavioral) and collect metrics.
 *
 * The only deviations from production are the ones we can't do unattended:
 * approvals are skipped and GitHub is mocked. Prompts, skills, phases, and the
 * agent loop are exactly what ships.

/**
 * Unified diff of the agent's final tree vs the seeded `base` commit — capturing
 * committed, uncommitted AND new/deleted files. Run inside the repo subdir, so
 * workflow scaffolding (AGENTS.md, .lastlight-skills/) at the workspace root is
 * naturally out of scope, and `git add -A` honours the repo's ignores (incl. the
 * harness's `node_modules` exclude from {@link seedWorkspace}) — so the diff is
 * the repo's own change alone. Staged into a throwaway index (`GIT_INDEX_FILE`)
 * so the repo's real index is untouched and the later `gradeExecution`
 * `git apply` still works.
