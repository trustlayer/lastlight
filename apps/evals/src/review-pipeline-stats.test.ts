/**
 * Tests for the pipeline-telemetry reader — deterministic and AI-free.
 *
 * The fixtures are **synthetic but shape-faithful**: every row form below was
 * copied from a real preserved workspace
 * (`~/lastlight-run-artifacts/2026-08-23_053348-…`) and then had its content
 * replaced. The real artifacts embed source excerpts from a private repository
 * and cannot be vendored here — the same reason
 * `nearform-evals`' `instances.json` is gitignored. What matters for this reader
 * is the shapes, and the shapes are exactly reproduced, heterogeneity included:
 *
 *  - the prescribed row (`discharge` + `failureScenario`),
 *  - the `spec` pass's invented `verdict` row, which carries no `id`, no
 *    `family` and no code at all — its renderer was unified only AFTER the last
 *    measured run, so this form is what every stored run actually contains,
 *  - the dead `tests` family's `{status: "notMeasured"}` line.
 *
 * A reader that only handled the prescribed form would silently report the other
 * two families as zero-hypothesis rather than as unmeasured, which is the exact
 * class of error this module exists to stop.
