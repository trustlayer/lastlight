 * §"The blocker on every per-gold number"; journal §"Rung 5"): **11 of 30
 * credited pairs were wrong**, in two even halves.
 *
 *   - *Polarity* (5) — a VERIFICATION REPORT credited to the gold it refutes.
 *     `INTERNAL_MATCH_SYSTEM` already forbids this in prose and still does it,
 *     so the clause is measured-insufficient; asking again is not the fix, and
 *     the fix here is not another clause but a different QUESTION. MATCH ranks
 *     candidates and must choose SOMETHING for every gold it can; CONFIRM is
 *     asked one closed question about one pair and may answer no to all of them.
 * The line between a verification report and a DISMISSAL is drawn deliberately,
 * and it is the one judgement call in here. `1667` gold #1 (auth runs after
 * body validation, so an unauthenticated caller gets a 400 before a 401) was
 * generated as *"preValidation rejects unauthenticated callers before
 * bearerTokenAuth can … recording as a dismissal: there is no unauthenticated
 * action this enables"* — the exact mechanism, correctly described, then talked
 * out of. That is a DISCOVERY the pipeline withheld, which is the one thing
 * internal recall exists to separate from never finding it at all, so it counts
 * as a match. A first pass of this prompt rejected it, which would have folded
 * a triage failure back into the discovery ceiling — the collapse the whole
 * instrument was built to undo.
 *
 *   - *Wrong subject* (6) — the transposition. Where two golds discuss the same
 *     subsystem, MATCH assigns between them on topic, and a finding that is
 *     precisely gold #4's claim lands on gold #3 while #4 reads MISS. Judged
 *     pair-at-a-time, against the gold's actual claim, that is visible.
 *
 * Kept OUT of `INTERNAL_MATCH_SYSTEM` rather than folded into it. The match
 * prompt is pinned by every back-filled run in the archive; this is additive, so
 * a corrected number and the number it corrects both exist, and the archive can
 * be re-judged without re-running MATCH (whose reply is stored as
 * `internalGold`).
