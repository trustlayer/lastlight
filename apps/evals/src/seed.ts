 * Deterministic workspace seeding for the code-fix tier.

 * the exact dir `setupTaskWorktree` would create) with a repo checked out at a
 * base commit, and points its `origin` at a LOCAL bare repo — so the real
 * workflow's `git push origin HEAD` succeeds fully offline with NO GitHub clone.
 * Because the eval calls `runWorkflow` with no `ctx.prePopulateBranch`, the
 * runner never triggers its own GitHub clone and the agent works directly in
 * this seeded dir.
 *
 * Two provenances, same end state:
 *   - {@link seedWorkspace}        — a vendored fixture dir (`repos/<id>/`).
 *   - {@link seedWorkspaceFromGit} — a real repo cloned into a repo-local cache
 *                                    and checked out at `base_commit`.
 *
 * The git-source clone is a HARNESS SETUP action, not the workflow cloning
 * GitHub — it touches the network only on a cache miss; the workflow itself
 * still operates on a pre-seeded dir with an offline `file://` origin.
