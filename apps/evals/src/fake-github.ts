/**
 * In-process fake GitHub REST API.
 *
 * agentic-pi's built-in `github_*` tools talk to GitHub via Octokit. With the
 * `githubApiBaseUrl` seam (added to agentic-pi), we point that Octokit at this
 * server instead of api.github.com — so a REAL workflow runs unchanged while
 * every GitHub call is served from seeded fixtures and RECORDED for behavioral
 * grading.
 *
 * Only the endpoints our workflows actually hit are implemented; anything else
 * returns 404 so gaps surface loudly rather than silently passing. The server
 * binds to 127.0.0.1 on an ephemeral port.
 *
 * ONE method is not a REST route: {@link FakeGitHub.fetchRepoConfigTree}. The
 * per-repo config layer (issue #180) is read by the HARNESS, not by an agent
 * tool, through `GitHubClient.fetchRepoConfigTree` — core's own seam for exactly
 * this ("lives on the client rather than raw octokit at the call site because
 * the evals harness swaps this whole seam for fixtures"). So the fake implements
 * that method rather than the two git-tree + blob endpoints underneath it, and
 * `FakeGitHub` is structurally a `GitHubClient` for the one call
 * `fetchRepoLayer` makes. See `src/repo-config.ts` for the injection.
